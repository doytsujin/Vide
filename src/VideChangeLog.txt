27th of November 2016
---------------------
Version 1.09

new: 
- vecci: Added menu entry "switch orientation" for a selected vector
- vecci: Split where needed with need edit value
- vecci: remove point (join two neighbouring vectors)
- tracki: added delete button
- tracki: added view to current cycle count (number based)
- tracki: now ignores "0" minimum values, also skips unrealistic high values in min/max/avg
- ym: three convenient buttons, to swap voices from one channel to another
- ym: added option to multiply an amplitude of a channel
- regi: added output of current running cycle count
- dissi: added breakpoint ability in write access to ROM (only from CLI in dissi)
- dissi: added to 'hey dissi "break"' an optional additional parameter 'once' -> 'hey dissi "break once"'
- assi: option to output unsued (but defined) symbols to CNT file
- vecxi: added emulation of DS2431

BugFix:
- vecci: saving of vectorlist did not correctly respect double/single usage of vertex
         using seperate vertex with the same position resulted in a single vertex after load -> fixed
         (Vertex have now an ID tag in the xml - due to processing loading of xml files without id tag
          takes a bit longer)
- dissi: enlarging from iconified state sometimes did not update the table (== crooked display)
         -> possibly fixed 
- vecci: another bug fixed with vectorlist loaded, where different single vertex with the same coordinates
         were falsely connected after a load from file
- vecxi: corrected false state loading, where Keyboard 0 could be unset

14th of November 2016
---------------------
Version 1.08

BugFix:
- vecci: Bug where joining of vectors could lose some vectors 

14th of November 2016
---------------------
Version 1.07

new: 
- vecxi: added timing parameters for T1 and SHIFT - I am getting more and more unhappy with the current delay emulation features (see blog).
         With the current emulation NOT in all circumstances (the more timing critical the more inaccurate) the results are like the real machine!
- config: window is now scrollable
- vecxi: HotKey Buttons "P" Pause/Unpause and "O" Overlay on/off
- library: added/changed some documents

BugFix:
- vecci: removed <another> possible deadlock scenarion in vecci with the animation preview (Thread) - damn that is annoying 
- vecci: fixed another vectorlist clone bug (vecci), that prevented (upon other things) to do a correct preview in the monitor
- vecxi: "manual" setting of CB2 through the via control register is only possible if shift is not output to PB2, this
         was not correctly emulated before
- vecxi: changed drift emulation slightly
- vecxi: efficiency emulation is now switched on per default

18th of October 2016
--------------------
Version 1.06
new: 
- vedi: upon closing of an editor, the corresponding file in the tree gets unselected

BugFix:
- vecci: images converted to vector, had a bad "border", when only a partial image was used
- vecci: HLR z = -z
- vecci: fixed bug, where "join here" resulted in a "lost" vertex
- ym: fix to playing AYFX with disabled noise (was choppy) 
- ym: streaming detecting of voice usage was flawd (always using 0 as target)

14th of October 2016
--------------------
Version 1.05
new:
- vecx: psg emulation, changed internal data generation to 16 bit + oversampling
- vecx: sound "lines" now inherent to psg section, not vecx, this makes it 
        easier to update the output to the lines directly when psg registers change,
        should be more acurate 
- ym: added "import" of ym data lines (from ascii file)
- dissi: added an ym 'line' to ayi
- vecx: added all neccessary code to implement the LED of "BinaryStars" Xmas Cart 2015
        to actually see the emulation, you need a ROM dump of the card, the "free" version does
        not contain the corresponding code sections.
- dissi: added to "hey dissi" #reg to print registers, e.g.: hey dissi "print #a #b", also $intx and $inty
- ym: added asm vectrex player for "streamed" data, also enhanced coder,
      streamed coder now analyses ym data and only encodes needed data, player is configured
      to only decode needed data with "if" statements.
      The player is without doubt the fastest, but also the one that does not - NOT pack very well...
- vecci: added a button for an extra editor window, that window displays the standard "editor" and is resizable, so
      larger editor areas are now available
- vecci: settings are now persistent (grid and scale)
- vecci: added a small scroll button section, you can now "move" in the editor window
      sideways (displacement width = gridwidth)
- all: allow open of multiple instances of vedi/codi/vecci (shift menu entry)
- vecci: included settings for output, db/fcb, hex/dec

BugFix:
- vedi: the list of last opened files could get scrambled - fixed

3rd of October 2016
-------------------
Version 1.04
new:
 - dissi: added 2 complement to register tooltip in reggi
 - dissi: added enhanced tooltip to CC in reggi
 - ym: added "player" mode
 - ym: shift double click on column textfield, sets the value to the complete (register) column
 - allow of envelopes in YM-file generation (in general)

bugfixes:
 - vedi: <again> seemingly fixed a bug, where the coloror was disabled
 - ym: possible Nullpointer Exception fixed
 - corrected ym-file generation output to respect reg13 as 0xff if no changes happened
 - corrected ym player in respect to that as well (both on the java side in YMSound and asm player in generation (only the new one))
 - corrected PSG emulation to correctly emulate envelope generation
   (although someday I have to enhance sample rates, as it is it emulation sounds quite terrible!)

1st of October 2016
-------------------
Version 1.03
new:
 - tracki: now also shows the average of the current timings
 - ym: added a new mode to export, this one is the new preffered export "module"
       also did bugfixing
       "preprocessing" of ym files as options, default is off, whether it is worth switching these
       on depends on the ym files themself

bugfixes:
- vecci: the last fixes disabled most of the source exports, this had to be fixed :-)

27th of Septmber 2016
---------------------
Version 1.02
new:
- vec32: added a "utility" window to support editing/saving/running of Vectres32 (BASIC) programs
         including editor (+ syntax highlighting) and a terminal
- vecci: added support to import Wavefront OBJ files
- vecci: support for hidden line removal and definition of faces
- vecci: points can be selected (deselected) by clicking on the corresponding columns in the vectorlist table
- vecci: export status reflects order of vectorlists
- vecci: added export for vectorlists to BASIC (Draw_VL_Mode only)
- vecxi: added emulation for the phenomenon, that integration is possible during "zero enable",
         also added emulation that zeroing is not spontanous but a going down to zero over time
- ym: added support to export data to BASIC (uncompressed only, and only "all" registers)
- doc: documentation for most of the mentioned changes/enhancements
- template: updated vectorlist templates to handle vectorlists > 8bit (length)
- template: templates for BASIC YM-Play and vectorlist display

bugfixes:
- vecci: deadlock in animation fixed
- vecci: shortcut buttons "order", "split", "connect" do not produce garbage when called with "deformed" vectorlists
         (deformed here: vertice that are "relative"- used by more than two vectors)
- dissi: CNT files a bit more robust in respect to "SPACES"
- vedi: possibly solved another deadlock with syntax highlighting
- vedi: bug where line numbering was not updated after "pasting" 
- sound: added log output to TinySound
- vecx: checks that TinySound is initialized (befor null pointer exceptions were thrown)

7th of Septmber 2016
--------------------
Version 1.01
bugfixes:
- dissi: double click on address row for small 16bit addresses did not work as intended
