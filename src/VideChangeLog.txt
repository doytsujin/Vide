3rd of October 2016
-------------------
Version 1.04
new:
 - dissi: added 2 complement to register tooltip in reggi
 - dissi: added enhanced tooltip to CC in reggi
 - ym: added "player" mode
 - ym: shift double click on columne textfield, sets the value to the complete (register) column
 - allow of envelopes in YM-file generation (in general)

bugfixes:
 - vedi: <again> seemingly fixed a bug, where the coloror was disabled
 - ym: possible Nullpointer Exception fixed
 - corrected ym-file generation output to respect reg13 as 0xff if no changes happened
 - corrected ym player in respect to that as well (both on the java side in YMSound and asm player in generation (only the new one))
 - corrected PSG emulation to correctly emulate envelope generation
   (although someday I have to enhance sample rates, as it is it emulation sounds quite terrible!)

1st of October 2016
-------------------
Version 1.03
new:
 - tracki: now also shows the average of the current timings
 - ym: added a new mode to export, this one is the new preffered export "module"
       also did bugfixing
       "preprocessing" of ym files as options, default is off, whether it is worth switching these
       on depends on the ym files themself

bugfixes:
- vecci: the last fixes disabled most of the source exports, this had to be fixed :-)

27th of Septmber 2016
---------------------
Version 1.02
new:
- vec32: added a "utility" window to support editing/saving/running of Vectres32 (BASIC) programs
         including editor (+ syntax highlighting) and a terminal
- vecci: added support to import Wavefront OBJ files
- vecci: support for hidden line removal and definition of faces
- vecci: points can be selected (deselected) by clicking on the corresponding columns in the vectorlist table
- vecci: export status reflects order of vectorlists
- vecci: added export for vectorlists to BASIC (Draw_VL_Mode only)
- vecxi: added emulation for the phenomenon, that integration is possible during "zero enable",
         also added emulation that zeroing is not spontanous but a going down to zero over time
- ym: added support to export data to BASIC (uncompressed only, and only "all" registers)
- doc: documentaion for most of the mentioned changes/enhancements
- template: updated vectorlist templates to handle vectorlists > 8bit (length)
- template: templates for BASIC YM-Play and vectorlist display

bugfixes:
- vecci: deadlock in animation fixed
- vecci: shortcut buttons "order", "split", "connect" do not produce garbage when called with "deformed" vectorlists
         (deformed here: vertice that are "relative"- used by more than two vectors)
- dissi: CNT files a bit more robust in respect to "SPACES"
- vedi: possibly solved another deadlock with syntax highlighting
- vedi: bug where line numbering was not updated after "pasting" 
- sound: added log output to TinySound
- vecx: checks that TinySound is initialized (befor null pointer exceptions were thrown)
