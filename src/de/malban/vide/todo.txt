NOT done (wont do):
  - LEX Macro syntax where a assembler instruction is concatinated from macros, like:
        ;Set the hi/lo part of a 16-bit register individually
        mCombine macro reg,hival,loval
        ld\1 #(lo hival)<<8 | (lo loval)
    endm
  - LEX same line, wont change lo hi, hi lo, which might be correct but shows as error
        these operators identify as variable, and two variables in a row are an error
        if syntax was not as flexible to allow lo Variable in stead of lo(variable) everything would
        be ok, but I rather be a little lax about the syntax!
  - LEX parenthesis: 
        lda (((2)+(1)) is no error, because at no stage arent enough closing brackets available...
  - ASM Might some day, not a priority- STRUCT Jup! :-( DEF.ASM (is that franks asm outpu???)
        Struct not done
  - LEX in OMEGA.as9  sprite_2           EQU sprite_1+#15       ;Start of structure for Sprite #2
        in the middle of nowhere a '#' should be wrong
        assembler accepts it, but IMHO that is not good, wont change!

3) I think the A is alright - or at least as it is "intended" - I propably could edit it a bit more... but now you see it is handmade :-).
Honestly - it is not easy to do a bitmap that looks alright.
See the vectrex uses the VIA 6522 and the models of VIA it uses has some bugs. One of its bugs is, that a complete shift cycle does not 
shift 8 times for one byte, but 8+1. The last shifted value is repeated.
So that e.g.
0101 0101 [e.g. part of a bitmap]

results in an output like:

0101 01011

In the normal "text" routines you do not see that, since letters always end with a "0" and a double "00" result just in a little bit more space between letters.
In a "continues" bitmap you must align or tweak the bitmap thus, that you do not (or only barely) see bit doubles.

I already did that (to some extend) to the title bitmap - and I thought I did a good job :-(.
It certainly is even more difficult to do if you are working with "diagonals", since you can not get rid of a double step.

Nonetheless, I will see if I can realign the complete bitmap, so that perhaps the "A"s - or at least the diagonals are not on a byte border.
