- Bei dieser Gelegenheit ist mir noch aufgefallen, dass in den Projekt xml Dateien 
  der Projektpfad (relativ zum Vide Binary) abgespeichert ist. Beim Kopieren/Verschieben 
  eines kompletten Projekt-Ordners stimmt diese Information dann nicht mehr, und es wird 
  alles an der alten Location gesucht und nicht mehr gefunden (bzw. beim Kopieren arbeitet das 
  Ganze dann unbemerkt auf dem „alten“ Folder). Wäre evtl. eine Funktionalität „load project“ 
  sinnvoll, die beim Laden der xml Projekt-Informationen schlichtweg den Pfad nimmt, an dem die xml Datei liegt?

    Eine weitere Ungereimtheit: Die Adresse für den Befehl ab $0042 wird geändert, wenn das Programm abläuft. Ich bin so vorgegangen: Das demo bin-File geöffnet, es wird dann dissi angezeigt, mit dem falschen Befehl "ldy #$53ff". Klicke ich dann auf Pause, schließe das dissi-Fenster, klicke auf den Associate Button im vecxi-Fenster, dann steht dort der richtige Befehl "ldy #$589d". Habe es nicht genauer debuggt, vielleicht wird da von irgendwo im Programm was geschrieben. Wäre wahrscheinlich besser, wenn das ROM nie geändert werden kann, es sei denn mit einer Option, für die Leute die SRAM-Cartridges testen wollen.

    Habe das gerade versucht.
    - bein „richtigen“ (ersten) starten ist dissi im der richtigen korrekt BANK (1) und zeigt dort den korrekten Wert an
    - Wenn Du dissi „zerstörst“ und neu auf machst, startet dissi im „default“ Zustand (BANK 0) - und dort steht tatsächlich ein anderer Wert.

    Das könnte man als Fehler von dissi bezeichnen, das er in der falschen BANK „neu startet“ - werde ich korrigieren.
    Aber im Grunde sind beide Werte richtig - der eine steht in BANK 0, der andere in BANK 1.
    Du kannst dissi auch manuell zwischen den Banks schalten lassen mit dem CLI:


Debugging RAM
--------------
a) in dissi switch "nu" (no unkown) to not selected (GUI checkbox)
b) better switch of "following" of dissi "df" (don't follow) (CLI command)
c) switch on disassemble ram with "dr" disasm RAM (CLI command)

Now RAM will be viewable in dissi.
But usually all RAM is configured as Data - so no code will be displayed.
While dissi is not tracking (camera is OFF) - best done also in pause mode,
mark a RAM memory region and via popup menu cast to code.
Perhaps you habe to "shift" memory regions, with "cast to byte" and "ungroup" also, to
access the addresses that need to be cast to code.

Disassembling RAM takes many resources, since the DISASM is done for each RAM - poke.
If you do not need to disasm RAM, you better leave it switched off.

Also note - disasm RAM might be usefull for bankswitch disasm.
The cast to disasm is only done for the current active bank in dissi.
Upon a bankswitch the casts have to be redone for the other bank!

  Open the Terminal app and write:

  Then restart any open app in which you want this setting to activate.
  REVERTING BACK: Just,simply add true in place of false to the previous command like this:

Wenn ich das richtig sehe, kann man dort ADRS und TWANG einstellen und dann einzelne Noten anspielen und anhören. 
Gibt es dort auch die Möglichkeit, eine komplette Melodie „im Original-BIOS-Format“ einfach abzuspielen?
Ich nutze momentan die BIOS Soundroutinen, und ich bin musikalisch absolut unbegabt. Also trial & error. 
Die Turnaround-Zeiten für das Ausprobieren kleiner Jingles erfordern immer ein C-Coding + Compile & Run und 
sind somit relativ lange. Daher wäre so ein Feature sehr nützlich.

done 
Ebenso nutze ich die BIOS Exlposion Routine. Ich bin damals auf keinerlei Doku hierzu gestoßen und habe dann 
per reverse engineering den Code von Star Castle studiert, um die Funktionsweise herausgefunden. 
Das war hart, aber durchaus spaßig. Auch hier wäre ein Ausprobier-Tool sehr hilfreich. 
Ist aber nicht dringendes, nur so eine Idee.

Done:
Bzgl. der Tabs ist mir Folgendes aufgefallen: Beim Editieren in Vedi liefert die Tab-Taste 
„Sprünge“ von 4 Spaces, genauso wie in Geany. Nach dem Einlesen meiner (Geany) C-Files in 
Vedi haben alle Tabs jedoch 8 Spaces. Der Code wird so recht „breit“ und läuft bei Mehrfachverschachtelung 
schnell rechts raus und wird unlesbar. Wenn ich dann in Vedi weiter editiere und neuen Code hinzufüge, 
werden (weiterhin) 4 Space Tabs generiert. Werden hier beim Einlesen/Unwandeln evtl. zu breite Tabs generiert?
 
done (but bad)
Und wo wir schon dabei sind, hat der Editor evtl. auch einen auto-indent nach Zeilenumbruch 
gemäß der Schachtelungstiefe der geschweiften {} Klammern (kennst Du sicherlich von anderen Editoren)?

- Regarding the "player 2 rotates with player 1" issue in "Spaceball": 
  We observed this behavior on the real machine (a "buzz" Vectrex) if there is no 
  controller plugged into port 2. If two controllers are attached, then everything behaves 
and works as expected. The code itself looks fine. Could this be some analog Vectrex hardware phenomenon?

Smallesst dissi step is 2 byte instruction
- this is also true for profiling

incorrect emulation:
Allow me the question, why do you use the function „Read_Btns_Mask“ instead of „Read_Btns“?

The mask version expects a „mask“ passed in register A. Which you don’t set - A is set to whatever value the print routines set (I think it is 03).
I haven’t gotten a clue why it works on the emulators - which is interesting and I should check at some time - but why not just do:


COLLIDES with info from Berzerk Arena 
Must check so that both are emulated ok

Just googling - no - potrace can't. It seems a program called "autotrace" can -> 
http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/

You need a feature called "centerline tracing"...

https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/60107/convert-a-line-drawing-from-raster-to-vector-lines

autotrace -centerline -color-count 2 -output-file output.svg -output-format SVG input.png
    -line-threshold [real]:
    If a spline does not deviate from the straight line defined by its endpoints by more than the specified number of pixels, then treat it as a straight line (default: 1).

    - line-reversion-threshold [real]:
    If a spline is closer to a straight line than this, weighted by the square of the curve length, keep it a straight line even if it is a list with curves; default is .01.


The conversion is done using a programm called potrace.
Perhaps there are options in potrace that would work - never looked at it. Maybe you can tell potrace "treat bitmap as vector" - if I have spare time I might do some research on that...

Don't use the original bios random routine ! It has a bug that might crash your game (it occured during my vector pilot development).

Here is a patched version of the routine (bios labels are based on fred taft's disassembly):

get_random_bugfixed:
;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
;+This function is a bugfixed version of the original bios get_random_a function.
;+
;+Inside the get_random_a and get_random_a2 routines of the vectrex BIOS.
;+A terrible bug is located: the X-pointer that needs to be pointing to
;+the random-seed in RAM is not loaded directly with the random-seed
;+address. Instead, it is loaded with the contents of the random-seed.
;+In some cases, this causes that new random-seed is written at random-places
;+in the memory map. Sometimes in a RAM-space, sometimes in a VIA-register.
;+This causes the program to crash !
;+
;+At entry: none
;+At exit : A = random-number.
;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
pshs b,x ;backup b,x
clrb ;seed of 0
get_random_bugfixed_B_rounds:
ldx #Random_Seed ;BUGFIX : set X-pointer to the ADDRESS-value of the random-seed !
jmp ran_loop ;continue with remaining ROM-routine (see exec-rom)

    The label that is visible in the screenshot is not a macro label per se - since it is a global label.
    You should either end it with \? or declare it as local after the header of the macro.
    If you use THAT macro several times, the label "bstart" gets redefined every time the macro is used. Which might lead to erratic behaviour.
    Nonetheless - I check if something is wrong. I am not sure if the keyword local correctly identifies macro labels - now that you mention it.

  - LEX same line, wont change lo hi, hi lo, which might be correct but shows as error
        these operators identify as variable, and two variables in a row are an error
        if syntax was not as flexible to allow lo Variable in stead of lo(variable) everything would
        be ok, but I rather be a little lax about the syntax!
