
NOT done (wont do):
  - LEX Macro syntax where a assembler instruction is concatinated from macros, like:
        ;Set the hi/lo part of a 16-bit register individually
        mCombine macro reg,hival,loval
        ld\1 #(lo hival)<<8 | (lo loval)
    endm
  - LEX same line, wont change lo hi, hi lo, which might be correct but shows as error
        these operators identify as variable, and two variables in a row are an error
        if syntax was not as flexible to allow lo Variable in stead of lo(variable) everything would
        be ok, but I rather be a little lax about the syntax!
  - LEX parenthesis: 
        lda (((2)+(1)) is no error, because at no stage arent enough closing brackets available...

  Parabellum: Lightpen in Port 1
  The Engine Analyzer ROM is not really a game per se (and not entertaining in anyway), 
  but is nonetheless interesting as it is the only binary I know of that makes use of a lightpen plugged in the first game port.
  When plugged in the second gameport, the lightpen's pin 4 is connected to the 6522's CA1 input pin, so the application 
  just polls the state of the 6522's CA1 interrupt flag to know if the pen detects the line that is just being drawn. 
  Also, the application will sometime setup the 6522 interrupt enable register so that it propagates a real IRQ to the CPU when CA1 is set.
  When connected in the first gameport, the lightpen may be used through the CPU's FIRQ (rather than IRQ), as the pin 4 
  of the first gameport is connected to the CPU's FIRQ line. This is how the Engine Analyzer program reads the lightpen inputs.
