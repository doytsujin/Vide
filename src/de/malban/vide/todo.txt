NOT done (wont do):
  - LEX Macro syntax where a assembler instruction is concatinated from macros, like:
        ;Set the hi/lo part of a 16-bit register individually
        mCombine macro reg,hival,loval
        ld\1 #(lo hival)<<8 | (lo loval)
    endm
  - LEX same line, wont change lo hi, hi lo, which might be correct but shows as error
        these operators identify as variable, and two variables in a row are an error
        if syntax was not as flexible to allow lo Variable in stead of lo(variable) everything would
        be ok, but I rather be a little lax about the syntax!
  - LEX parenthesis: 
        lda (((2)+(1)) is no error, because at no stage arent enough closing brackets available...
  - ASM Might some day, not a priority- STRUCT Jup! :-( DEF.ASM (is that franks asm outpu???)
        Struct not done
  - LEX in OMEGA.as9  sprite_2           EQU sprite_1+#15       ;Start of structure for Sprite #2
        in the middle of nowhere a '#' should be wrong
        assembler accepts it, but IMHO that is not good, wont change!
  - DIS not done  - won't do ? or? if we are at it, also in between comments!
        (comments for lines which are grouped (in group) are not generated!)

do a stack frame window (for U, S X Y) with definable vars (byte word, named)
which can be saved to cnt

also a saveable "notes" window

correct pb6 breakpoints fo in and out


add a bank mode, where all breakpoints are set/erased in all banks

Next:

- thread syntax color in vedi still somtimes lost

examin, if stalling is really only triggered by a "read" of via (at the moment by a read from clr)

save and load input devices of vecx

analog windows, button correct? -> NO

possible future games:

- vedi right mouse click on data statements -> convert to vector / call vecci
- vecxi try own handwritten graphics primitives for glow on byte array of buffer
- vecxi try ray gun with handwritten graphic rouines, perhaps on a 255x255 grid, which might be scaled...

  these can be automatically unpotimzed vie versa - not...
- dissi build automatic comments for VIA access
- bug?  copyDirectoryAllFiles(String from, String to) for subdirs!
  bug? works under windows...

The sound emulation does not work correctly for the game VectorPilot (by Kristof Tuts). This is especially obvious for the player's shoot, that sounds quite different on the emulator and on a real vectrex.

Unlike most of the vectrex games, VectorPilot does not update the PSG register only once per frame (about every 20ms). Instead, it does modify the sound registers about every 5ms (roughly 4 times per frame) to output a high-quality sound.

By design, ParaJVE is only updating the sound wave at the end of every frame ; thus the "intermediate" writes to the PSG registers done by VectorPilot are ignored, plain and simple. To achieve a perfect rendering, the sound emulation sub-system must be refactored to update the waveform data whenever a PSG register is accessed (filling a temporary buffer, that will be consumed at the end of the frame, when the sound waveform is to be output).

In combination with this, you can also reload external modifications made to the ROM directly from within ParaJVE, 
without having to restart it : just select the "Rebuild / Reload ROM" menu item and you're done (no matter what kind 
of ROM you're running - binary or source).
This latter feature was added in an attempt to make ParaJVE more homebrew developers friendly. This great idea was suggested 
by Alex of Vectorzoa, who has started an effort to involve more people into vectrex creation... If you're interested, run and
