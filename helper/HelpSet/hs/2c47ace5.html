<h1>In general!</h1>

<p>The application "state" of VIDE is in, is more or less persistent (if development keeps up).</p>

<p>As of now, VIDE remembers its open windows their size and their positions.</p>

<p>There are a few "main" windows and quite a few "child windows". Once any window is open - the gui makes no difference between main and child.</p>

<p>"My" difference between main- and child- windows is the place where they can be opened. Main Windows can be opened from the Menubar, there from the menu: "Tools":</p>
