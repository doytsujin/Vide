<p>Well - also straight forward... all known variables (named RAM-locations) are shown.</p>

<p>You can update the variables name on the fly, the disassembly in dissi will reflect the changes, all references to the variable will be updated.</p>

<p>Same with comments.</p>

<p><b>all known...</b><br>
In case you need more than all known locations, you can add locations using the  <img src="pics/add.png" alt="add.png"> button (this mainly comes handy if RAM-locations are used via accessing with the use of the DP register)</p>

<p><b>breakpoints</b><br>
As shown in the image above, you can also set breakpoints to ram locations. 
<ul><li>
<p>read: triggered when the ram location is read</p>
</li><li>
<p>write: triggered when ram location is written to</p>
</li><li>
<p>value: triggered when ram locations is written to with a certain value</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p><b>use label as data</b> You can force a label to be also be recognized as "immediate data". If you force that, dissi is able to use an address in immediate addressing.</p>

<p>That means, if e.g.</p>

<p><tt>$c880 has a label start_ram</tt><br>
</p>

<p>and an assembler directive like:</p>

<p><tt>LDU #$c880</tt><br>
 </p>

<p>is encountered, dissi than can recognize the immediate label and output:</p>

<p><tt>LDU #start_ram</tt><br>
 </p>

<p>... for better readability.</p>
