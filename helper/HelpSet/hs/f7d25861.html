<h1>"perfect" Vectorlists</h1>

<p>Some function in Vecci only work with perfect vectorlists. What makes a vectorlist perfect?</p>

<ul><li>
<p>a perfect vectorlist is ordered</p>
</li><li>
<p>all vectors are drawn "full" with a pattern of 255</p>
</li><li>
<p>all vectors are connected with their natural order</p>
</li><li>
<p>all vectors face the "correct" direction</p>
</li><li>
<p>all vectors have a length smaller than 127/128 (depending on the sign)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Think of perfect vectorlists as a drawing you can make with a pencil, without ever taking the pencil off the paper.</p>

<p>These vectors can be exported to any of the supplied formats.</p>

<p>They are in general quite performant. They should not be longer than (about) twenty vectors (otherwise on a real vectrex they will "drift").</p>
