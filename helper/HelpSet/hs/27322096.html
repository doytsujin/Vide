<h1>Bankswitching</h1>

<ul><li>
<p>Bankswitching is handled in class Cartridge (triggered by emulation)</p>
</li><li>
<p>cartridge can hold an arbitrary number of banks</p>
</li><li>
<p>dissi memory is now loaded via cartridge (after vecxi has been initialized), that is new!</p>
</li><li>
<p>dissi adds itself to cartridge as a listener and reacts to bankswitched</p>
</li><li>
<p>the Memory (dissi/dasm) class has been updated to handle banks too, MemoryInformation is still held seperately from cartridge</p>
</li><li>
<p>in Memory ALL memory data is switched upon a bankswitch, even ROM data</p>
</li><li>
<p>that enables us e.g. to have different label names systemwide (mainly interesting for ram locations)</p>
</li><li>
<p>breakpoints have now a field "bank" and should be banks considered, meaning setting a breakpoint for address 1000 on bank 0 should not trigger a breakpoint at address 1000 while in bank 1 (not tested)</p>
</li><li>
<p>development wise I must still consider the options of building seperate bin files and concat, or in one go or or or</p>
</li><li>
<p>done: generate dissi: dasm output</p>
</li><li>
<p>done: generate dissi: CNT out</p>
</li><li>
<p>not done: reading lst, cnt for banks &gt;0</p>
</li><li>
<p>not done: actually compiling without manual interference of multi banks</p>
</li><li>
<p>done: consequently building information for different banks</p>
</li></ul>
