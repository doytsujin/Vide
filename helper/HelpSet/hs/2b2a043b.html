<h1>"still ok'ish" Vectorlists</h1>

<p>Many function in Vecci do not work with "ok'ish" vectorlists. What makes a vectorlist only ok'is?</p>

<p>any one of the following criteria makes a vectorlists at best "ok'ish"</p>

<ul><li>
<p>not ordered or only partialy orderd</p>
</li><li>
<p>some vectors are not connected or form only small "paths"</p>
</li><li>
<p>the directions of connected vectors are in opposition<br>
 <br>
</p>
</li><li>
<p>all vectors have a length smaller than 127/128 (depending on the sign)  </p>
</li></ul>

<p>These vectors can only be exported to "synced" list.</p>

<p>Depending on the purpose of such a list - the format might still be usefull. A synced list can be used to draw very large vectorlists which do not show signs of drift.</p>

<p>To scratch some performace out of this format see that as many "sections" of such a vectorlist are "good" vectorlists as possible.</p>

<p>You can check that by using the button under the tab: "build animation" -&gt; tab: "Scenatio" -&gt; button "seperate paths as scenario entries".</p>

<p>The number of such generated scenario entries represent the minimum numbers of syncs a synced list needs. </p>

<p>Try to edit the vectorlist so that as many "sections" are "good" or "perfect" - and thus that there are as few as possible "scenario" entries.</p>
