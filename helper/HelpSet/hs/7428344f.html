<h1>"still possible - but really bad" Vectorlists</h1>

<p>Many function in Vecci do not work with "still possible - but really bad" vectorlists. What makes a vectorlist only "still possible - but really bad"?</p>

<ul><li>
<p>if there are many or all vectors "individual" vectors, that  are not connected to any other vectors<br>
 <br>
</p>
</li><li>
<p>if the vectorlist is perfect or good and contains very many vectors (e.g. &gt;50)</p>
</li><li>
<p>all vectors have a length smaller than 127/128 (depending on the sign)  </p>
</li></ul>

<p>These vectors can only be exported to "synced" list (not if good or perfect - these lists just look bad on a real vectrex).</p>

<p>The sync list generated is a real performance "hog", since it will sync after each such vector.</p>

<p>Try to avoid these kind of vectorlists at all cost!</p>
