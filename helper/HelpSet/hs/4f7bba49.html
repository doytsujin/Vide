<h1>VecLink V2</h1>

<p>The new cable (V2) just avoids this by not using pin 4. It means we have 1 less pin for data which should in theory reduce the maximum bandwidth, but I was able to optimise it quite well and didn't loose much performance. </p>

All other pins MUST NOT be connected.<br>
(or damage to your Vectrexes is quite probable).<br>
