<h1>"Known Features"</h1>

<ul><li>
<p>when running in Open GL mode and you have more than one vecxi instance open. If you full-panel or full-screen once of the vecxi, all other instances will lose their opengl reference. There is no crash - but the display is not working as long as the reference is not "reset". A simple window resize will do the trick...</p>
</li><li>
<p>Vedi and Dissi seperately have a configuration for a vecFever device - this is stupid - and should be corrected</p>
</li><li>
<p>Projects in Vedi under windows must not be located on a seperate mount point/disk - because all paths are stored internally "relative" - a different HD can not be accessed relative and will produce errors</p>
</li><li>
<p>in rotated mode mouse interaction with emulator is handled wrong </p>
</li></ul>
