<h1>Code Generation</h1>

<p>Vide, mainly through vedi, supports generating code for various purposes.</p>

<p>Upon creating a project:
<ul><li>
<p>main game loop</p>
</li><li>
<p>bankswitching</p>
</li><li>
<p>eEprom support</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>Using aditional tools available from vedi menus:
<ul><li>
<p>building and play routines for samples</p>
</li><li>
<p>conversion and play routines for mod files</p>
</li><li>
<p>building and display of raster images</p>
</li><li>
<p>building and play of YM-files</p>
</li><li>
<p>building and play of AYFX sound effects</p>
</li><li>
<p>building and play of vecVoice/vecVox data</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>With the help of vecci:
<ul><li>
<p>building and display of vector images</p>
</li><li>
<p>building and play of vectorlists
<ul><li>
<p>different vectorlist types </p>
</li><li>
<p>animations</p>
</li><li>
<p>scences</p>
</li></ul>
</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>Once planned but not done code generation: Veclink cables.<br>
 <br>
- The code generation would have been little more than the provided examples. The code can not easily be used in ones own code and be at the same time used as an example. </p>

<p>For that reason I left these out as code generations. The provided examples are well documented and should give anyone interested in implementing a game or other binary a good starting point and many routines can be just copied and pasted from that base. </p>
