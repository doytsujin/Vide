<h1>BIOS functions</h1>

<p>All BIOS functions are supported by the current C-setup. The naming convention is that of Bruce Tomlin. To use BIOS functions (and/or variables) include &lt;vectrex.h&gt; to your C-programs.</p>

<p>The standard include path defines its location at: <br>
<tt>"...Vide/C/PeerC/vectrex/include/vectrex.h"</tt><br>
</p>

<p>Looking at the above file (and its following include hierarchy) you will see how Peer implemented all BIOS calls with inlined "C" functions.</p>

<p>Also when you generate a new "C" project, the <b>doc</b> directory as a quick access also lists the most important includes in a very well himan readable form.</p>

<p>Also all RAM/VIA locations are defined in a ways that makes them easily accessable.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
