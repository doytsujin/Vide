<h1>Emulation: Sprites Mod - extreme Vectrex "BadApple"</h1>

<p>see: <a target="_blank" href="http://spritesmods.com">http://spritesmods.com</a></p>

<p>On the above page "Sprites" describes his building of an "extreme vectrex multicard" and his efforts to bring a vectorized "movie" onto the vectrex.</p>

<p>Vide as a small "bonus" is able to play the described extreme vectrex files (file must be configured in cartridge define).</p>

<p>On infomation how to build such a file look at the above page or at Malbans blog under: <a target="_blank" href="http://malban.de/extreme-vectrex-reproduction-of-badapple">http://malban.de/extreme-vectrex-reproduction-of-badapple</a></p>

<p>Provided with Vide is the bad apple example I described in the above blog entry.<br>
(a vectrex cart with a size of about 12mb)</p>
