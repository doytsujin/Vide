<p><b>Assume vectrex files</b><br>
This option might surprise you in Vide, but fact is - the stand alone version of dissi could probably disasssemble other programs as well... Therefor this option sort of makes sense (nah - it doesn't...).<br>
Anyway if enabled dissi scans it's files for a typical vectrex heading, like the GCE entry and the following string list.</p>

<p><b>build generic labels</b><br>
If disassembling unkown sources, dissi generates lables (in the form of "_XXXX" - where "XXXX" is the actual address) instead of using the address directly.</p>

<p><b>column setup</b><br>
Straight forward - configuration which columns should be displayed in the dissi main table. Changes are applied at once!</p>
