:title VIDE

Vide is a collection of different sources - and some new creations - in a single application.~~
It is a **V**ectrex **I**ntegrated **D**evelopement **E**nvironment.

I do not intend to make VIDE an "emulator of choice".



It will not be as pretty as ParaJVE, it will not be as fast as VecX and it won't be as "elegant" as the MAME/MESS emulation.

I am a pragmatic guy not one for beauty or aesthetics.
