**Why?**~~
Does this window look different than all the other panels?
~~
Hm, no reason - I did it on a different day, or even in a different month, so I somehow decided to do it this way.

**But it is bad, to have different looks in one application, the poor users...?**~~
Yep... I know. Still. learn to live with it, or change the sources yourself!

:h2 Save as Bin/Data/YM-file
There is a new option to now save the PSG output (not digital sound as of yet).

:h3 YM file
YM-files consist of register information of the PSG, which are (best) saved at specific intervals.
The file format was developed by Arnaud Carr√© originally for Atari ST sound files. (See: [[http://leonard.oxg.free.fr/ymformat.html]])

:h3 Data
Chosing this option the PSG data will be saved to assembler compatible db-statements, 16 registers per row .

:h3 Bin
Chosing this option the PSG data will be saved to binary "raw" data 16 registers repeatedly.

:h3 Record when?
You can chose to the intervall at which data shall be recorded by two different options:
- record when address = xxxx~~
For example each time after a subroutine that updates sound registers is called (do_sound)
- or you can give a fixed timed intervall in 6809 cylce information (30000 cycles = 50Hz)

:h3 Buttons
- ##control_record_blue.png## __**start recording**
- ##control_stop_blue.png## __**stop recording**~~Only after stopping properly, data files will be saved!
