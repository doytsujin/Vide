Vector information window.~~
Here you can see some data of a selected vector. The data shown are:
- on the first line you see the currently drawn count of vectors~~
The count is related to the display routine though â€“ which means patterned vectors are not counted as one vector, but are counted by how many times the light is switched on or off - this will NOT be fixed - this is a feature not a bug :-)!
- the coordinates 
- a tooltip displays the distance
- intensity of the vector
- the PC where the ~BLANK signal became 1 (when the vector was finished drawing)
- and the callstack at that time
- double click on PC will initiate jump to that address in dissi
- double click on a callstack address will initiate jump to that address in dissi

Notice:~~
The callstack is not the contents of the stack!~~
The callstack only has "subroutine"-return-adresses!~~
Callstack is only available if "collect vector information" is enabled in the configuration.

**Mouse**~~
Below the callstack, while moving over the emulation window, you can see the mouse-coordinates displayed. These coordinates are calculated to represent the actual integrator values needed for that position. This means the mouse coordinates are displayed in vectrex integrator/coordinates.
