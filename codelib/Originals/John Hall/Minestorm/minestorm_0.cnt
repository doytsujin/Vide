COMMENT_LINE $0000 Minestorm as gotten from John Hall's web site:
COMMENT_LINE $0000 https://roadsidethoughts.com/vectrex/mine-storm.htm
COMMENT_LINE $0000 this version was "fitted" to be compilable with Vide
COMMENT_LINE $0000 changes made:
COMMENT_LINE $0000 1) exclude all linker stuff
COMMENT_LINE $0000 2) replace all „.“ with „_“
COMMENT_LINE $0000 4) ensure all RAM locations are „BSS“
COMMENT_LINE $0000 5) LDA X (and the like) statments changed to LDA ,X
COMMENT_LINE $0000 6) changed the name and added "copyright" so that the resulting binary
COMMENT_LINE $0000 a) is runnable as a seperate cartridge
COMMENT_LINE $0000 b) still has the same address for "ENTRY"
COMMENT_LINE $0000 that way addresses are stilll compareable to the BIOS version
COMMENT_LINE $0000 (just add $e000)
COMMENT_LINE $0000 (data addresses after the last subroutine, might be different since this might be
COMMENT_LINE $0000 the bugfixed version!)
