DRAW_VLC_DIGIT
and
DRAW_VLP_DIGIT
One could load the timer value to U (or so)
and just ADD #CYCLE TIME to
the counter
 LEAU CYCLE_TIME,
 CMPU next_digit_play_time
FÅr kleine scales wÅrden dann wahrscheinlich die punkte
nicht so lange hell, und insgesamt (vielleicht schneller :-))


MY_DIV_D_BY_TMP1_TO_B

use of dp

Samples probably played to often during
Wait Recal (waiting)

Maze as bits! Saves 240 bytes per maze!

Samples allways played upon exit of Draw_Vlp and Draw_Vlc-
probably not neccessary (waiting)

Labyrinth vectors:
 - shortend
 - only draw
 - only move

Map drawn with shiftreg bits for maze bits?
than draw 16 vectors, 8 horizontal and 8 vertically...
perhaps draw whole maze? (32 vectors!)
