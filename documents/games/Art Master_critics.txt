Art Master came packaged in with the Vectrex Light Pen and was fun program that allowed you to draw vector graphics right on the screen! It was a blast to see your own creations displayed in brilliant light vectors and show it off to your friends and family members.
This cartridge required the Vectrex Light Pen accessory. There were three modes... Sketch, connect and animate. Providing endless hours of creativity and exercising your imagination.
You could draw a world you have seen in your dreams, or draw an airplane and then animate it to fly across the screen, or even a boat and have it float across the water. The possibilities are endless. All in all a ton of fun!
I would say that this cartridge rates 9-10, controls 7-10, and overall 8-10. So if you want a fun diversion on your Vectrex, this is a great choice to spark your creativity.
