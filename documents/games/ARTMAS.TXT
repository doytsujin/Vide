ART MASTER
########## 

ART MASTER is a high performance,
state-of-the-art experience that takes you into
a world of art exploration you've never seen
before! Finally, sketching comes of age... and
your creativity comes to life!
Advanced electronics technology now
makes it possible for you to design, draw, and
animate your own art! Draw a bird. Then
watch it fly! Sketch a train. Then send it
speeding down the railroad tracks! Watch a
flower blow in the wind or children walk to
school. What you create...you can animate!
You don't have to be a super-artist to
use and enjoy Art Master. All you need is a
sense of adventure, fun and a little imagina-
tion! We'll show you how to make Art Master
the key that unlocks all the creativity you've
always known you had!


Setting Up
==========
* Make sure the console power cord is plugged into a
  120 volt AC 60 cycle electrical outlet.

* Check to be sure the plug for the built-in control panel
  is firmly seated in the control panel outlet on the right.

* Plug the Vectrex Light Pen into the outlet marked '2nd
  Player' (to the left of where the control panel is plugged
  in).

* MAKE SURE THE CONSOLE IS TURNED OFF BE-
  FORE INSERTING THE CARTRIDGE. Insert the ART
  MASTER cartridge into the cartridge slot with the label
  side up. Be sure it is firmly inserted to the guideline
  marked on the cartridge.

* Turn the OFF/ON/VOLUME CONTROL to the ON posi-
  tion (clockwise). You will see the Vectrex title for a few
  seconds, then the ART MASTER title, followed by the
  Menu.

* Adjust the volume control to the desired listening level.

* IMPORTANT-Adjust the BRIGHTNESS CONTROL
  (on back of console) so that the white dot in the center
  of the screen just barely disappears. If the brightness is
  too dim, the Light Pen will not provide maximum
  performance


How to Play
===========
There are three separate functions on the Art Master
cartridge - SKETCH, CONNECT and ANIMATE. We'll
take you through each function and work with you on
some simple exercises. After you've learned the basics,
the rest is up to you! Ready? Your art adventure is about
to begin!

The Menu
--------
After the Vectrex overture plays, a Menu listing all three
functions of the Art Master cartridge will appear on your
screen.

SKETCH

CONNECT

ANIMATE

To make a selection, point the Light Pen at the appro-
priate word. The other two words will disappear and
your chosen function will begin. The following sections
of this instruction book will explain in detail how the three
Menu selections work.


SKETCH
------
To enter the "SKETCH" mode, point your Light Pen at
the word "SKETCH" when the Menu appears on your
screen. The other two Menu items will disappear In the
SKETCH mode you'll be able to create virtually anything
you want - fill up the entire screen or just a portion of it.
To start sketching, aim the Light Pen at the "+"
symbol on the screen. Using your Light Pen, move the
"+" to your desired starting position.

Draw Lines
~~~~~~~~~~
To draw lines, press and hold Button 1 on the control
panel while you move the "+" around the screen with
your Light Pen. The slower you draw the easier it will be
to create curved lines. To draw another figure or object
on a different part of the screen, release Button 1 and
move the "+" with your Light Pen to a different starting
position. Then press and hold Button 1 again as you
draw the second figure.

Remember to keep the Light Pen close to the screen
or touching the screen. If you move the Light Pen too far
away from the surface of the screen, you will see a large
burst of light (like a spider web) and the Light Pen will
not operate properly.
While sketching, you may hear a "beep" tone. This will
tell you that you have only ten lines left to draw before
you've used all the available vectors ... so finish your
creation quickly!


Strrrrretch Your Imagination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Move the "+" with your Light
Pen anywhere on the screen
this will be your starting point.
Now press and hold Button 2
and move the Light Pen around
the screen ... watch your line
stretch and pull to all directions
just like a rubber band! Release
Button 2 when your straight line
is at the desired location and is
the desired length.

Make Fans
~~~~~~~~~
Press and hold Button 4 and SKETCH
move your Light Pen in a circular
motion to form a "fan" of lines
around a central point. Go left or
right, up or down. It makes no
difference which way you move
your Light Pen. Form flower tops,
cosmic explosions, stars,
dozens of other creations.
To erase your creations and
begin again, simply point your Light Pen at the word
"ERASE" at the bottom of the screen and press Button 3.
To return to the Menu for other Art Master functions,
point the Light Pen at the word "MENU" and press
Button 3.

Sketch Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1) Draw
    Press and hold while moving Light Pen.

(2) Stretch
    Press while moving
    Light Pen to draw a straight line
    Release Button when line is desired length.

(3) Erase Menu
    Press while placing Light Pen over "ERASE" or
    "MENU". ERASE clears the screen. "MENU" returns you to the Menu.

(4) Fan
    Press while moving
    Light Pen in a circle to create a
    "fan" effect.


CONNECT
-------
To enter the "CONNECT" mode call up the Menu by
placing the Light Pen over the word "Menu"" and then
press Button 3. When the Menu appears aim the Light
Pen over the word "CONNECT".
Now you're off on a totally new art experience Your
drawings appear on the screen in a series of uncon-
nected dots  and all with the simple swirl of your Light
Pen! Write words, draw spaceships, faces or scenes
then just push Button 4 and watch your dots suddenly
connect and change to lines!
This mode simply allows you to draw graphics in a
series of dots rather than in full lines, as in the "SKETCH"
mode. Press and hold Button 1 to draw dots or Button 2
to draw straight lines (i.e. a dot at either end of a
straight line). Release the buttons to move the "+" to
another position on the screen. Press Button 4 to con-
nect the dots Pressing Button 4 again will allow you to
return to dots.
You may want to design a pattern or code and create
it in dots. Then ask a friend to guess what you've drawn.
Connect them together by pressing Button 4 to see if
your friend got it right! Every time you push Button 4,
you change your drawing, sketch or design from dots to
lines and then back again.

Connect Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1) Draw
    Press and hold while
    moving Light Pen to create dots.

(2) Stretch
    Press while moving
    Light Pen to draw a straight line
    (dot at either end). Release Button
    when line is desired length.

(3) Erase/Menu
    Press while
    placing Light Pen over "ERASE"
    or "MENU". "ERASE" clears the
    screen. "MENU" returns you to
    the Menu.

(4) Connect
    Press to connect
    your dot pattern Press again to
    return to dots


ANIMATE
-------
Living art... moving designs... swirling drawings! When
you use your Art Master in the "ANIMATE" mode" you
really make your artwork a moving experience!
Draw an animal... and make it move! Sketch a cen-
tipede... and watch it run! Draw soldiers... and march
them across the screen! Become a pioneer in the new
Space Age frontier!
You have up to 31 lines in this mode to draw graphics
...then animate them!

Creating the Basic Figure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To draw your initial figure (which you will later animate),
aim the Light Pen at your desired starting point and
press Button 1 to get a dot and the "+" to appear. To
create a line starting at this dot, aim the Light Pen at
another point and press Button 2.

To create your figure, use Buttons 1 and 2 to define
starting points and draw lines. To close a figure, aim the
Light Pen at a previously defined point  when it is
detected, a square will appear around the point. Then
press Button 2. You can also move the  "+" by aiming
the Light Pen at your desired new starting point and
pressing Button 1.

Adjusting the Figure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can make adjustments to your basic figure before
beginning to animate it. To make adjustments, aim the
Light Pen at any point on your figure. When the point is
detected, a square will appear around the point. Press
Button 3 and then move the point with the Light Pen.
which will also move all lines connected to that point
(like a "rubber band" effect). Release Button 3 when that
point is in the desired location. Continue to adjust your
figure in this manner until it is completed to your satis-
faction. To remove a line, aim the Light Pen at the line
and it will appear slightly brighter Then press Button 4
to remove the line.

Animating the Figure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To advance to Frame 2 and begin animating your basic
figure, aim the Light Pen at the word "NEXT" at the
bottom of the screen and press Button 3, You will also
hear a "beep" to indicate that you have advanced to the
next frame.
Once in Frame 2, you can alter your figure in any
desired way using the same method described in "Ad-
justing the Figure". If you wish to see the previous frame's
figure, press Button 4, You can remove the previous
frame's figure by pressing Button 4 again,
You can also remove the words from the bottom of the
screen by pressing Button 1, This will reduce any
"flicker" in your drawing Pressing Button 1 again will
cause the words to reappear.
Once you have the figure adjusted as desired in
Frame 2, you can advance to Frame 3 and beyond using
the same procedure, There are 9 frames available for
your animation, but you need not use all of them, You
may animate on as few as two frames,
Once all the desired frames are drawn, aim the Light
Pen at the word "PLAY" at the bottom of the screen and
press Button 3 to see your animation in action. Once in
this play mode, you can speed up the animation by
pressing Button 4 one or more times... or slow it down
by pressing Button 3 one or more times.
Pressing Buttons 1 or 2 will return you to the "Edit"
mode. You can go backwards or forwards to any frame
to re-edit that frame by aiming the Light Pen at "LAST"
or "NEXT" and pressing Button 3 one or more times.
To return to the "CREATE" mode or the main Menu at
any time, aim the Light Pen at the appropriate word at
the bottom of the screen and press Button 3.
