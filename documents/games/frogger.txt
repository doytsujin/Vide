It's a jungle out there . . . or at least a swamp!

Guide your frogs across a road and through a
swamp to the safety of their home.

The homes are at the top of the screen. Only
one frog can use each home.

Each frog must reach home before they die
of natural causes. Time remaining is shown
as a line at the bottom of the screen.

For reasons unknown, your frogs can not swim.

A level is completed when all homes are
occupied. There are 16 levels.

You start with 5 frogs, An additional frog will
be awarded after every 10,000 points.

Pause the game to view your score, number
of frogs and level number.

While you are hopping around, have a nice
juicy fly, save your girl, & watch out for snakes!
