Outer Space is a dangerous place!

To get home you must "hop" from moon
to moon. Each landing will bring you 1
step closer to home.

You must make 32 landings to make it home
alive.

You start with 3 ships. An additional ship will
be awarded after every 5 successful landings.

Each moon has different terrain, gravity and
wind.

There is a fuel limit on every landing.

You can only land on designated landing pads.
Each landing pad is marked with it's fuel bonus
multiplier.

Oh yeah, did I mention the satellites & killer
satellites?

Good Luck and God Speed!
