Clean Sweep (GCE 1982) F
I think I'm going to be ill. There are good Pac-Man clones and there are bad Pac-Man clones. This is a bad one. In some ways it's downright appalling. In the idiotic background story, you are a vacuum in a maze at a bank, and robbers are pursuing you. There are four special rooms in the corners of the bank that allow you to "supercharge" and turn the tables on the robbers. Okay, it's not very original, but is it fun? Hell no! First off, this game is long and moves slow as molasses. I couldn't wait for it to end! Even worse, you vacuum can only hold so many "coins", so you have to return to the center of the maze to empty yourself periodically. But perhaps the worst travesty is the Pac-Man sound effects. They're good, but shamelessly stolen from a MUCH better game.
