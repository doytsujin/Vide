This game was packaged with the Vectrex 3D Imager to show off it's capabilities and was never released separately. This was an re-imagining of the original Mine Storm game in 3D. To play it, you must place the color wheel into the 3D Imager.
Gameplay is the same as the original only now you get a convincing 3D spin on it. The technology was rudimentary but the effect is quite good!
Can you survive all of the levels and clear the spaceways of the dangerous mines?
The renewed fun of this version of Mine Storm has me saying that the game play for this cartridge rates 8-10, controls 8-10, and overall 8-10. It is truly a fun game that you won't mind sinking time into to play.
