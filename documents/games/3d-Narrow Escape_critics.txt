This game requires the Vectrex 3D Imager goggles. You must battle your way through the fortress of an evil Warlord bent on enslaving a world... hey wait, doesn't that sound kind of like the Fortress of Narzod in space?
I can't describe the game better than they did in the manual where they say "Your mission is to navigate through the narrow and fast-moving passages of the fortress and destroy the warlord's defense forces and his powerful arsenal. Beware...the passages of the fortress will encircle you in 3-D terror while the warlord's defense systems will become more menacing. Will you succumb to the evil of the warlord or destroy him and make a Narrow Escape?!"
This is a fun romp into 3D and I must say that the game play for this cartridge rates 7-10, controls 7-10, and overall 7-10. It is great 3D experience that you won't mind sinking hours into.
