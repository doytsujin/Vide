How to Play

Player Selection
   SpinBall can be played as either a one or two-player game. When ÒPLAYER 1Ó appears on the screen, press Button 1 once to switch to a two-player game.  ÒPLAYER 2Ó will then show on the screen. When played as a two-player game, only the built-in control panel is used. Players take turns using this control panel. You can return to a one-player game by pressing Button 1 again before starting game play.

Starting Game Play
   Once you select the number of players, press Button 4 to automatically prepare the pinball table with your first of five balls.

Game Play
   When your ball appears at the bottom of the chute, use the Joystick to set the tension on the plunger spring. (The further back you pull the Joystick, the more speed your ball will have when it is released). Press Button 4 to release the ball into play. Use Buttons 2 and 3 to control the left and right sets of flippers which will help keep the ball in motion.
   Once the ball is in play, use the Joystick to control the hitting or "juking" of the pinball table. This traditional pinball feature helps influence the motion of the ball. But be careful, if you use the Joystick too often in a short period of time, you will "tilt" the machine and lose the ball in play.
   Your goal in SpinBall is to keep each ball in play as long as possiblet hitting as many targets as you can and scoring the greatest number of points. There are a total of five balls in the game.

Score Multiplier
   The Score Multiplier is the number followed by an "x" that appears above your score. It indicates the number by which accumulated Bonus points will be multiplied when added to your score. The maximum Score Multiplier is 6. The multiplier is increased by activating the Ball Splitter or simultaneously lighting all four bumpers.

Center Chute Diamonds
   The three center chutes at the top of the table are con nected with the four six-sided bumpers located directly below them. When your ball passes through one of the chutes while the diamond is still on, a 500-point Bonus is scored and one of the bumper lights will be activated. If the diamond in the chute is not on when your ball passes through, then 1500 points are scored and a bumper light will not be activated. If you activate the lights in all four bumpers without hitting any of them, you will increase your Score Multiplier.
   When all the diamonds are turned off, they will automati cally "rest" and one of the Ball Saver arrows will be turned on for a short time (see below).

Six-Sided Bumpers
   When your ball hits one of the six-sided bumpers at the top of the table, the bumper will flash and 15 points will be scored. If the bumper light is on when it is hit, an additional 500 points will be scored and the bumper light will go out.

Spinners
  There are four spinners located at the top left corner, at the middle of the right side and in both lower corners. When ever a ball passes through one of these spinners, 300 points are scored. The spinners' bonus arrows are acti vated by hitting any set of Drop Targets in order (see below). When the Bonus Arrow is on and your ball passes through that spinner, a 2000-point Bonus is scored and the Ball Splitter is activated for an unlimited period of time.

Drop Targets
   There are five sets of Drop Targets located on either side of the center chutes and below the right and left upper flippers. When all targets in a set are hit, a 100 point Bonus is scored for each target. If the targets are hit in order (from right to left or left to right)/ then 200 Bonus points are scored for each target. This also activates the Spinner Bon~s Arrows and the Ball Splitter is activated for a short period of time.

Ball Bplitter
   The Ball Splitter is the star-shaped object that will flash in the center of the table. If your ball lands on the Ball Splitter while it is activated, the ball will split into two balls, which are then put into play at the same time, and a triangular bumper will appear between the lower flippers. If the ball lands on the Ball Splitter when it has been activated for an unlimited amount of time, your Score Multiplier is increased. There can only be two balls in play at one time.

Ball Savers
   There are two Ball Savers located in both chutes in the lower corners of the ta'ble. Normally, when your ball enters either of the chutes, it is lost and the next ball is put into play. When a ball enters a chute with a Ball Saver on, the ball is caught, returned to play, and a 1000-point Bonus is scored.

Glassies
   Just like in real pinball when a ball jumps over a bumper or barrier/ your ball will sometimes appear to go through a bumper or wall. Continue to play the ball as you would normally. There are no penalties or points awarded for Glassies.
