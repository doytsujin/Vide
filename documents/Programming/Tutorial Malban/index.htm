<p>Hello! </p>

<p>These pages are for all vectrex lovers. If you look for
information about vectrex, and how the thing is programmed, you
have come to the right place. </p>

<p>There are not many places where you will find so much
information about the vectrex as this little place. </p>

<p>These pages will not stagger you with blinding graphics, they
actually will be quite boring for people not interested in
vectrex programming and technical details, that's ok. </p>

<p>I have programmed a little bit of code for the vectrex, and
I'd like to share my experiences with other interested people.
Here are my collected vectrex resources... </p>

Part of an optimization thread in the newsgroup. <br>
Not a very rewarding text to read. This discussion seems to have
some effect on<br>
Clay. Since than he didn't release any more source codes to the
Vectrex community<br>
(not even MoonLander final, which is a shame :-().</p>
