Well, what am I gonna say about Vectrex. People looking at this page probably know much
more about that thing than myself. I never had one, I never even seen one in real life
yet.
<BR><P></P>
Vectrex was released during my early teens and I was allways fascinated by it, though
back then I didn't have enough money to afford one. And now... well I haven't tried all that
much to get one, but I think they are quite hard to come by (in Germany at least).
<BR><P></P>
Nevertheless I think that machine is marvelous and it is a pitty it had such a short
life. You might have noticed that I like emulators a lot (probably because I'm a nostalgic
sort of guy...), they tend to bring back the memories of the good'ol times.
Anyway I thought about doing a vectrex emulator of my own. But behold... all of a
sudden a Vectrex emulator appeared. I started actually my own emulator, but Keith
released his source code when I was still at an very early stage... so I conveniently
droped the whole notion and spied at his source instead. At first I didn't do all that much,
since I didn't have a Watcom compiler. Borland doesn't come with any DOS-extender so
porting would have been very stressing. Huge parts of his emulator (the 6809...) were
written in assembler. So porting to DJGPP was out of question too (coff...).
Finaly I got a copy of Watcom 10.6 (no, not pirated... bought it for about 180,- DM...).

Oh well, I got carried away... if you interested in vectrex emulator gossip, why don't you
look at the <A HREF="vemu.htm"> apropriate page</A>.<BR>

Since I don't have a vectrex what do you expect me to say about it?<BR>


<P></P><BR>
Nothing yet... perhaps in the future...<BR>
