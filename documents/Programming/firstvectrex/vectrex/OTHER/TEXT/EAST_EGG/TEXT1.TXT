I'm not sure how I did it but when my game was over in Polar Rescue, I
got the phrase "M.INDICTOR" in the midddle of my radar screen!
Anybody else ever seen this?

After seeing this, I started browsing through the ROMs and here is
what I found:

In 3D MineStorm, there is the text,
   PROGRAMMED BY WILLIAM HAWKINS
              1983
  VECTREX AND IMAGER BY JOHN ROSS

In Armor Attack I found:
   Disable   Block   Listen   Learn   Frwrd

In Bedlam I found:
   Called From: *PC: *SR: !!Address Registers: Data Registers: Fatal Error

In Heads Up I found:
   Drive   Track   Sector   DMA address   Read address

In RipOff I found:
   THIS SPACE AVAILABLE   WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT ???

In Spinball I found:
   MARK INDICTOR

In Web Wars I found:
   Watch for these great games coming soon from G.C.E.
   Cosmic Chasm -- soon to be a big hit with Cinematronics,
   Hyper Chase -- THE car race game,
   Bedlam -- a fast paced test of nerves and skill
