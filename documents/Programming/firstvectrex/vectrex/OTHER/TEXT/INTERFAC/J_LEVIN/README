The dualport schematic allows you to place executable code into a static
ram connected through the cartridge slot. The other side connects to
a system which shares the static ram. Once the executable is in
the RAM you must write protect it (use WPM switch), switch the RAM
to the vectrex and hit reset.

The serial interface provides the same functionality through a 9600 baud
connection and will support RAM at address $2000.

Look at the source to get an idea of the functions provided by the
monitor. Use either of the two above interfaces or modify a game
cartridge to take a standard EPROM and program the monitor into
it.
