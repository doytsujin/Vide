6522 VERSATILE INTERFACE ADAPTER

 This one is take from the VIC 20 Programmers Reference Guide which has got
Commodores name all over it so I'm guessing it might be a bit more correct.
There were a few mistakes that I picked up, so keep your eyes peeled because
there could be more.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The 6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA) provides the VIC with two
peripheral ports with input latching, two powerful interval timers, and a
serial-to-parallel/parallel-to-serial shift register.
 Basically, the VIC chip handles Audio/Video input/output, and the 6522
handles the rest. . .  cassete operations, joysticks, RS-232, and user port.

PORT B I/O REGISTER

 These eight bits are connected to the eight pins which make up port B. Each
pin can be set for either input or output.
 Input latching is available on this port. When latch mode is enabled the
data in the register freezes when the CB1 interrupt flag is set. The register
stays latched until the interrupt flag is cleared.
 Handshaking is available for output from this port. CB2 will act as a DATA
READY SIGNAL. This must be controlled by the user program. CB1 acts as the
DATA ACCECPTED signal, and must be controlled by the device connected to the
port. When DATA ACCEPTED is sent to the 6522, the DATA READY line is cleared,
and the interrupt flag is set.

PORT A I/O REGISTER

 These eight bits are connected to the eight pins which make up port A. Each
pin can be set for either input or output. Handshaking is available for both
read and write operations. Write handshaking is similar to that on PORT B.
Read handshaking is automatic. The CA1 input pin acts as a DATA READY signal.
The CA2 pin (used for output) is used for a DATA ACCEPTED signal. When a
DATA READY signal is received a flag is set. The chip can be set to generate
an interrupt or the flag can be polled under program control. The DATA
ACCEPTED signal can either be a pulse or a DC level. It is set low by the
CPU and cleared by the DATA READY signal.

DATA DIRECTION FOR PORT B

 This register is used to control whether a particular bit in PORT B is used
for input or output. Each bit of the data direction register (DDR) is
associated with a bit of port B. If a bit in the DDR is set to 1, the
corresponding bit of the port will be an OUTPUT. If a bit in the DDR is 0,
the corresponding bit of the port will be an INPUT.
 For example, if the DDR is set to 7, port B will be set up as follows:

       BITS NUMBER     DDR     PORT B FUNCTION
            0           1         OUTPUT
            1           1         OUTPUT
            2           1         OUTPUT
            3           0         INPUT
            4           0         INPUT
            5           0         INPUT
            6           0         INPUT
            7           0         INPUT

DATA DIRECTION REGISTER FOR PORT A

 This is similar to the DDR for port B, except that it works on PORT A.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TIMER CONTROLS

 There are two timers on the 6522 chip. The timers can be set to count down
automatically or count pulses received by the VIA. The mode of operation is
selected by the Auxiliary Control Register.
 TIMER T1 on the 6522 consists of two 8-bit latches and a 16-bit counter.
The various modes of the TIMER are selected by setting the AUXILIARY CONTROL
REGISTER (ACR). The latches are used to store a 16-bit data word to load into
the counter. Loading a number into the latches does not affect the count in
progress.
 After it is set, the counter will begin decrementing at 1 MHz. When the
counter reaches zero, an interrupt flag will be set, and the IRQ will go low.
Depending on how the TIMER is set, either further interrupts will be disabled,
or it will automatically load the two latches into the counter and continue
counting. The TIMER can also be set to invert the output signal on a
peripheral pin each time it reaches zero and resets.
 The TIMER locations work differently on reading and writing.

WRITING TO THE TIMER

 E: Write into the low order latch. This latch can be loaded into the low
    byte of the 16-bit counter.
 F: Write into the high order latch, write into the high order counter,
    transfer low order latch into the low order counter, and reset the TIMER
    T1 interrupt flag. In other words, when this location is set the counter
    is loaded.
 G: Same as E.
 H: Write into the high order latch and reset the TIMER T1 interrupt flag.

READ THE TIMER

 E: Read the TIMER T1 low order counter and reset the TIMER T1 interrupt flag.
 F: Read the TIMER T1 high order counter.
 G: Read the TIMER T1 low order latch.
 H: Read the TIMER T1 high order latch.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TIMER T2

 This TIMER operates as an interval timer (in one-shot mode), or as a counter
for counting negative pulses on PORT B pin 6. A bit in the ACR selected which
mode TIMER T2 is in.

WRITING TO TIMER T2

 I: Write TIMER T2 low order byte of latch.
 J: Write TIMER T2 high order counter byte, transfer low order latch to low
    order counter, clear TIMER T2 interrupt flag.

READING TIMER T2

 I: Read TIMER T2 low order counter byte, and clear TIMER T2 interrupt flag.
 J: Read TIMER T2 high order counter byte.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

K: SHIFT REGISTER

 A shift register is a register which will rotate itself through the CB2 pin.
The shift register can be loaded with any 8-bit pattern which can be shifted
out through the CB1 pin, or input to the CB1 pin can be shifted into the
shift register and then read. This makes it highly useful for serial to
parallel and parallel to serial conversions.
 The shift register is controlled by bits 2-4 of the Auxiliary Control
Register.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
L,M,N,O,P: AUXILIARY CONTROL REGISTER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

L: TIMER 1 CONTROL

  BIT  #   7   6
           0   0     One-shot mode (output to PB7 disabled)
           0   1     Free running mode (output to PB7 disabled)
           1   0     One-shot mode (output to PB7 enabled)
           1   1     Free running mode (output to PB7 enabled)

M: TIMER 2 CONTROL

  TIMER 2 has 2 modes. If this bit is 0, TIMER 2 acrs as an interval timer in
one-shot mode. If this bit is 1, TIMER 2 will count a predetermined number on
pin PB6.

N: SHIFT REGISTER CONTROL

  BIT  #   4  3  2
           0  0  0   SHIFT REGISTER DISABLED
           0  0  1   SHIFT IN (FROM CB1) UNDER CONTROL OF TIMER 2
           0  1  0   SHIFT IN UNDER CONTROL OF SYSTEM CLOCK PULSES
           0  1  1   SHIFT IN UNDER CONTROL OF EXTERNAL CLOCK PULSES

           1  0  0   FREE RUN MODE AT RATE SET BY TIMER 2
           1  0  1   SHIFT OUT UNDER CONTROL OF TIMER 2
           1  1  0   SHIFT OUT UNDER CONTROL OF SYSTEM CLOCK PULSES
           1  1  1   SHIFT OUT UNDER CONTROL OF EXTERNAL CLOCK PULSES

O: PORT B LATCH ENABLE

 As long as this bit is 0, the PORT B register will directly reflect the data
on the pins.
 If this bit is set to one, the data present on the input pins of PORT B will
be latched within the chip when the CB1 INTERRUPT FLAG is set. As long as the
CB1 INTERRUPT FLAG is set, the data on the pins can change without affecting
the contents of the PORT B register. Note that the CPU always reads the
register (the latches) rather than the pins.
 Input latching can be used with any of the input or output modes available
for CB2.

P: PORT A LATCH ENABLE

 As long as this bit is 0, the PORT A register will directly reflect the data
on the pins.
 If this bit is set to one, the data present on the input pins of PORT A will
be latched within the chip when the CA1 INTERRUPT FLAG is set. As long as the
CA1 INTERRUPT FLAG is set, the data on the pins can change without affecting
the contents of the PORT A register. Note that the CPU always reads the
register (the latches) rather than the pins.
 Input latching can be used with any of the input or output modes available
for CA2.

T: CA1 CONTROL

 This bit of the PCR selects the active transition of the input signal applied
to the CA1 pin. If this bit is 0, the CA1 interrupt flag will be set on a
negative transistion (high-to-low). If this bit is a 1, the CA1 interrupt flag
will be set on a positive (low-to-high) transition.


 There are two registers associated with interrupts: The INTERRUPT FLAG
REGISTER (IFR) and the INTERRUPT ENABLE REGISTER (IER). The IFR has eight
bits, each one connected to a register in the 6522. Each bit in the IFR has
an associated bit in the IER. The flag is set when a register wants to
interrupt. However, no interrupt will take place unless the corresponding
bit in the IER is set.

UVWXYZab: INTERRUPT FLAG REGISTER

 When the flag is set, the pin associated with that flag is attempting to
interrupt the 6502. Bit U is not a normal flag. It goes high if both the
flag and the corresponding bit in the INTERRUPT ENABLE REGISTER are set. It
can be cleared only by clearing all the flags in the IFR or disabling all
active interrupts in the IER.

cdefghij: INTERRUPT ENABLE REGISTER

c: ENABLE CONTROL

 If this bit is a 0 during a write to this register, each 1 in bits 0-6 clears
the corresponding bit in the IER. If this bit is a 1 during a write to this
register, each 1 in bits 0-6 will set the corresponding IER bit.
