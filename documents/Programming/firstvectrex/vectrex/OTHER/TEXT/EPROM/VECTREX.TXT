I kind of suspected that this was what is going on.

Hmmm... I wonder if I should review the pinout on the bus.  Perhaps I've hooked
the write-disable line up incorrectly?  In order to make my cartridge, I looked
at the bus pinout (available from ftp on csus.csus.edu) and also examined the
4kb ROM connections in the prefabricated Star Trek game to verify that
everything seemed correct.  Then, I grabbed a blank cartridge, inserted a dip
socket for an 2764 (an 8k EPROM), and wired it up.  I found two wiring errors
when I was done, but went back and fixed them.  Perhaps there is still a wiring
error, though I examined it repeatedly over a period of several days.

The 8k EPROMS should be able to handle all of the games except the ones with
the extra RAM on the cartridges.  BTW, does anyone remember which games NEED
the extra RAM?  Some people e-mailed and mentioned this to me or inquired if I
knew which ones do.

Don't sweat it... it's cool of you to post a reply!  Thanks for the
information!
