Description:

   The Atari Trackball CX80 has 2 modes. (A switch on the back
   changes the mode.)  In Joystick Emulation Mode it acts like
   an 8 direction joystick . In Trackball Mode it acts like a
   true trackball, providing both direction and speed of
   movement.

   The adapter described in this document allows an Atari CX80
   Trackball in Joystick Emulation Mode to be used as an 8
   direction controller on the Vectrex. Hyperchase is the only
   Vectrex game that will not work with this adapter.
   (Hyperchase requires an analog controller.)
     =

Risks:

   This is my first ever electronics project. All I know is that
   using this adapter has not burned-up my Vec or my trackball
   . . . YET!
   =

   Build it and use it at your own risk.

Background:

   I saw the Atari Trackball in a close-out store, and I bought
   it with the intention of using it on my Vectrex. I then
   started surfing the net and posting notes on various user-
   groups to figure out how to do it.
   =

   After finding my answers, I built and tested it on a
   breadboard. I had it working 2 hours after I started. I
   thought I was home free. Then I tried building it on a
   Printed Circuit Board (PCB) by soldering. Two days and
   several ruined circuit boards later I was still trying.
   That's when I switched to Wire Wrapping. Wire Wrapping is
   tedious, but it's easy to correct mistakes without chucking
   the whole project and starting over. (After testing, it is
   very easy to solder the Wire Wrapped connections.)

                                     tool.

Note: These instructions assume that you are using Radio Shack
Project Box/Circuit Board 270-283.

1. Prepare Project Box
   =

   The 9-pin connectors must be mounted from the outside.  I
   mounted them as shown:
   =

   Top View:
                              +-----+ Female 9-Pin
                              |     | (Vectrex)

                +-|                              |-+
                  |                              |
                  |                              |
                  +------------------------------+
   =

   To allow maximum clearance for the components, mount the
   connectors close to the top of the box. (The metal side is
   the bottom.)
   =

   a) Cut out holes for 9-Pin connectors. Holes should be just
      large enough for the back side of the plug to fit though.
      Drill a 3/8" hole and enlarge with a small file or
      nibbler.
      =

   b) Cut 1 piece of sheet metal to fit inside the box against
      each side with a connector. They should slide between the
      mounting posts and the sides of the box. When pushed into
      place they should not extend beyond the circuit board
      mounting posts (the shorter posts).
      =

   c) Cut holes in sheet metal parts to match the connector
      mounting holes in the project box.
      =

   d) Use the connectors as guides to drill the 1/8" holes for
      the machine screws in the project box & sheet metal parts.
      =

2. Wire 9-Pin Connectors
   =

   Vectrex Controller & Port Connections:
        =

        Pin 1: Button 1
        Pin 2: Button 2
        Pin 3: Button 3
        Pin 4: Button 4
        Pin 5: Joystick: Horizontal
        Pin 6: Joystick: Vertical
        Pin 7: +5V
        Pin 8: Ground
        Pin 9: -5V
        =

   Trackball Connections:
   =

        Pin 1: Up
        Pin 2: Down
        Pin 3: Left
        Pin 4: Right
        Pin 5: ----
        Pin 6: Fire Button
        Pin 7: +5V
        Pin 8: Ground
        Pin 9: ----
        =

   The 9-Pin Connectors' solder connectors are numbered. (You
   may need a good light and a magnifying glass to see them.)
   Remember that the pin numbers on the male and female
   connectors are mirror images.
   =

   a) Cut the 9 conductor cable to get 3 - 3" segments.
      Use a small screwdriver to poke-out the inner wires.
   =

   b) Assign a wire color to each pin number & WRITE THEM
      DOWN!!!
      =

      Here's the colors I used, but your wire colors may vary:
   =

        Pin 1: White
        Pin 2: White Stripe
        Pin 3: Red
        Pin 4: Red Stripe
        Pin 5: Green
        Pin 6: Green Stripe
        Pin 7: Blue
        Pin 8: Orange
        Pin 9: Black
   =

   Wire your connectors using your color chart.
      =

      Strip about 1/8" from each end of the wires before
      soldering. (I know: Duhh!)
      =

      After soldering check all connections. If you have spare
      connectors: plug in a mating connector then use you multi-
      meter to check the connection from the wire to the spare
      connectors matching solder terminal.)
   =

   c) Solder a wire to every pin on the Vectrex Connector
      (9-Pin Female).
   =

   d) Solder wires to the following pins on the Trackball
      Connector (9-Pin Male): 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
   =

   e) Solder a wire to pin 8 of the Button Connector (9-Pin
      Male).
   =

   f) Mount the Vectrex Connector and Trackball Connector in the
      project box and fasten with machine screws and machine
      nuts.
   =

   g) Pull the Vectrex Connectors wires 1, 2, 3 & 4 and
      Trackball Connector's wire 6 through the hole for the
      Buttons Connector.
   =

   h) Cut the Vectrex Connectors wires 1, 2, 3 & 4 and Trackball
      Connector's wire 6 just so they are just long enough so
      that you can solder them to the Buttons Connector from the
      outside the Project Box.
   =

   i) Solder the wires to the Buttons Connector as follows:
   =

   Pin 1: Vectrex Connector Wire 1
      Pin 2: Vectrex Connector Wire 2
      Pin 3: Vectrex Connector Wire 3
      Pin 4: Vectrex Connector Wire 4 and
             Trackball Connector Wire 6
      =

      Wiring the Trackball Fire Button (Connector Wire 6) in
      with the Vectrex Button 4 (Connector Wire 4) will allow
      the buttons on the Trackball as additional Button 4s.
   =

   j) Mount the Buttons Connector in the project box and fasten
      with machine screws and machine nuts.
      =

3. Make a Wire Wrap PCB Terminal
   =

   I could not find PCB Terminals made for wire wrapping, so I
   adapted the standard PCB Terminals.
   =

   9 Terminals are needed. The terminals I bought were in blocks
   of two that attached to each other by a "sliding dovetail
   joint" (I may not know much about electronics, but I know my
   woodworking terms!)
   =

   a) Slide terminals together to make a strip of 10.
   =

   b) Bend each of the 9 1-inch stiff wires into an L.
   =

   c) In each terminal: insert a short leg of the "L", with the
      long leg sticking down and tighten the screw.
      =

4. Mount the components on the circuit board.

   The circuit board has copper solder rings around each hole on
   one side of the board. For soldering: the components should
   be mounted on the side opposite the solder rings. For wire
   wrapping: the components should be mounted on the side with
   the solder rings. (This will reduce the chance of a loose
   first wire wrap loop from shorting out to a neighboring wire
   wrap post.)
   =

   I fooled around for an hour to figure out a layout that
   spaced the components as widely as possible and did not bump
   into the connectors when the circuit board was installed in
   the circuit board. Here's my layout:
   =

            +-----------------------------------+

            +-----------------------------------+
   =

   The notch on the 4052's sockets represents the top of the IC.
   =

   The Wire Wrap PCB Terminal is represented by the long
   component numbered 0 - 9. Mount the terminal strip on the
   circuit board with the long legs of the "L"'s extending down
   through the circuit board. The PCB Terminals wire holes
   should be mounted pointing away from the other components.

   After mounting the components, tuck the wires up in the
   project box and test fit the circuit board into the project
   box. (The Wire Wrap Posts and leads will stick out the bottom
   of the box, they will be trimmed later.)

5. Wire Wrap it.
     =

   a)   The remaining 9-Pin Connector Wires will be fastened to the
      PCB terminals at the end of the project. Now it's time to assign
      a function to each of the PCB Terminals and WRITE THEM DOWN. Here
      is my list:
      =

      Terminal 0: Vectrex Joystick: Horizontal
      Terminal 1: Vectrex Joystick: Vertical
      Terminal 2: Vectrex +5V and
                  Atari   +5V
      Terminal 3: Vectrex Ground and
                  Trackball Ground and
                  Buttons Ground
      Terminal 4: Vectrex -5V
      Terminal 5: Trackball Up
      Terminal 6: Trackball Down
      Terminal 7: Trackball Left
      Terminal 8: Trackball Right
      =

   b) Wire Wrap the circuits.
   =

   The circuit design is by Jay Tilton. Jay designed the circuit
   to use an Atari 2600 Joystick on the Vec. I found that it
   also works the Atari Trackballs.
   =

   I E-mailed Jay to request permission to reproduce his design,
   but he did not reply.
   =

   You can find the component wiring design on Jay's page:
   http://fbox.vt.edu:10021/J/jtilton/games/tech/index.html
   See the design for the "Vectrex Digital Stick Adapter".
   =

   Before wrapping trim the resistor leads so that the Wire Wrap
   Tool can reach lead's bottom.
   =

   Use the different wrapping wire colors to distinguish the
   circuits. I had three colors, so I wrapped the Ground Circuit
   with white, the +5 V Circuit with red, and everything else
   with blue.
   =

   Multiple connections are made on one wire wrap post or lead
   by stacking one wire wrap connection on top of another. In
   this design, it is never necessary to wrap one post or lead
   more than twice.
   =

   To make the circuits, chain the connections together. If A, B
   & C must be connected to ground. Wrap a wire from the ground
   PCB terminal to A, a second wire from A to B, and a third
   wire from B to C.
   =

   When wiring the sockets, remember that you are working from
   the bottom. Depending on how you flipped the circuit board,
   the connections are flipped either upside-down or side-to-
   side.
   =

   After each circuit is completed (EX: All ground connections),
   use the multi-meter to verify that electricity flows and
   check for shorts. (+5V and -5V ARE connected through 29.4K
   Ohms of resisters.)
     =

6. Connect It
     =

   The Vectrex Controller Port is a standard 9-pin male
   connector, but it is in a deeper than standard socket. Trim
   the Genesis Controller Extension Cord's head with a utility
   knife to fit the Vectrex's port.
   =

   End View:
      Before:           After:
      +-----------+     +-----------+
      |  -------  |     |  -------  |
      |  \=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D/  |     |  \=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D/  |
      |   -----   |      \  -----   /
      +-----------+       \--------/
     =

7. Test it!

   a) Using your Connector Wire Color Chart and your PCB
      Terminal Function Chart, connect the 9-pin connector wires
      to the PCB Terminals. Where there is more than 1 wire
      connected to 1 PCB Terminal, twist the wires ends
      together.
      =

   b) Plug the ICs into the sockets. Be sure to orient the ICs
      correctly, the little dimple at one end of the IC marks
      the top of the IC.
   =

   c) Make sure the Trackball is in Joystick Emulation Mode. The
      switch is located on the back of the trackball next to the
      cable.
      =

   d) Hook-it up!
      =

      If you have a Multi-cart, use the TEST program to check
      out it's operation. If not, use a program that uses all 8
      joystick directions.
      =

      Good Luck ! ! !
     =

8. Solder it

   Note: Soldering is not required, but it is highly
        recommended.

   a) Remove the ICs from the sockets.
   =

   b) Disconnect the 9-pin connector wires from the PCB
      Terminals.
   =

   c) Use a wire cutters to trim the Wire Wrap Posts and leads
      just above the wrapping wire.
   =

   d) Solder all the connections by holding the soldering gun to
      one side of each Wire Wrap Post and the solder to the
      opposite side of the post. You will get a good connection
      if the solder is melted from the heat of the component,
      not by direct contact to the soldering iron.

9. Box It

   a) Trim the 9-pin connector wires so they are just long
      enough to connect to the appropriate PCB Terminal. Then re-
      strip the ends and reconnect the wires to the PCB
      Terminals.
      =

   b) Remount the ICs in the sockets.
      =

   c) Mount the circuit board in the project box.
      =

   d) Verify the Wire Wrap Posts and leads will not contact the
      metal bottom of the project box. Trim or bend any
      offending posts or leads.
   =

   e) Attach the project box bottom.

10.   Play it !!!
