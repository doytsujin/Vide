Title  FYI: How to replace a  Vec Controller cable.
From:    Mark S.

A missing or damaged Vec Controller cable can be replaced with a Sega
Genesis Extension Cable. These are avaliable from Toys-r-Us for $10.

1) Open the controller.

   The controller is fastened with 5 screws under the label on the top
   side of the controller. One screw is located near each corner of the
   label (ex: One is under the "IN" in "MADE IN TAIWAN"). The fifth
   screw is to the right of the cable, at the top of the "V" in
   "VECTREX".

   Removing the label will destroy it. It's better to cut out holes
   where the screws are located with an exacto-knife. To exactly locate
   the screws, press the label with a pen or pencel point, you will see
   the label flex when it's over a screw.

2) Recycle the strain relief.

   Cut the old cable just above the strain relief. Pull the strain
   relief off of the wires (don't disconnect the wires from the circut
   board).

   All or part of the OLD CABLE CASING can be removed from the
   strain relief by pulling it from the BOTTOM of the strain-relief.

   Any remaining old cable casing can be removed by gently drilling
   it out.

3) Prep the new cable.

   Cut the Sega Genesis Cable to length, I suggest 2 feet. (This will
   give a working length of 18 inches).

   The sides of the plug must be trimmed to fit in the Vec's socket.

      +-----------+       \--------/

   Slowly and carfully enlarge the strain-relief using a drill. Only
   drill it out 1/64 an inch at a time to avoid tearing it.

   Lubricate the end of the new cable and inset it into the strain
   relief. it should stick through about 4 inches.

4) Connect the new cable:

   remove the new cable casing below the strain relief and attach to
   the Vec Controler wires as follows:



   Pin    Vec Color   Sega Color
    1     Green       Brown
    2     Yellow      Red
    3     Orange      Orange
    4     Red         Yellow
    5     Brown       Green
    6     White       Blue
    7     Gray        Grey
    8     Black       Black
    9     Blue        White

    I soldered the connections, then insulated them with heat-shrink
    tubeing.

5) Screw it back together.

6) Have a blast.
