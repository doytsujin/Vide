Converting a Tandy Joystick to use with the Vectrex
===================================================

These instructions relate to the Tandy 26-3123 Deluxe Joystick only.

The main problem in converting the joystick for use with the vectrex is that
the sense of the vertical axis needs to be reversed. Since the potentiometers
in this unit are formed by resistive traces on a plastic plate (the 'Pot
Plate'), it's not a simple matter to reverse the connections to one of the pots.
Here's how to do it.

1) Remove the 4 screws from the underside of the joystick, and take off the
   lower cover. Set these parts aside

2) Carefully lift up the 'Pot Plate', and note where the wires are connected.
   Disconnect the wires. Note that 2 of the connections are linked by a
   (red) wire.

3) Disconnect the wires on the PCB. Note where the 3 wires (white, red, black)
   which go to the switches in the joystick handle are connected. Set the
   joystick cable aside. You'll need to recover the push-on tags from this
   cable later.

4) Remove the 2 screws, the PCB, and the fire button + springs. Set these parts
   asside for the moment.

5) Note how the joystick mechanism is assembled. The aim is to rotate the
  'Pot Plate' and the sliding contacts counter-clockwise by 90 degrees. To
   do this, first unclip the 2 return springs from the mechanism

6) Lift out the pivot from the centre of the sliders, and then remove the
   sliders. Note how they are fitted

7) Remove the plastic base from the joystick mechanism. You need to rotate this
   through 90 degrees also, so that the sliders will fit correctly. In order
   to do this, enlarge the hole that will be in the lower right corner using
   a 7.5mm drill from the side that faces the joystick handle, until the
   plast base will fit correctly in this orrientation.

8) Now you start reassembling the parts. Refit the plastic base (rotated
   through 90 degrees), the sliders (metal contacts on the left and top as
   you look at them), the central pivot, and the return springs (over the top
   left and bottom right bosses).

9) Slide the fine trim controls off the pot plate _carefully_. Hold the
   pot plate so that the track side is uppermost, the connection pads are on the
   top and right sides, and the fine trim controls are on the bottom and left
   sides. Refit the fine trim controls by sliding them on, takeing care to avoid
   damaging the contacts.

10) Use the socket end of a Sega extension cable for the connection to the
    Vectrex. Remove about 4" of outer covering from the cable, and recover 3
    clips from the original cable. Do not touch the red jumper lead for the
    moment.

11) Crimp and solder these tags to the Green (pin 5, Pot0), Blue (Pin 6, Pot 1)
    and Grey (pin 7, +5V) on the cable. Now cut the red jumper wire complete wit
    it's tags from the original cable. Solder the white lead from the cable to
    one tag on the jumper wire.

12) Reconnect the leads to the pot plate in the following way, seen from the
    track side

             White + Red Jumper (-5V)
               /         Blue (Pot 1)
              /          /       Grey (+5V)
             /          /       /
            /          /       /
      +-----####------####----####-----+    Green (Pot 0)
      |                                |   /
      |                                #  /
      |                                # /
      |                                #
      |                                |
      |                                |
      |                                |
      |                                |
      |                                |    Red Jumper
      |                                #   /
      |                                #  /
      |                                # /
      |                                |
      +--------------------------------+

13) Now take the PCB you removed earlier. Carefully desolder the slide swtich
    from it. Also cut the track between the fire button on the PCB and the
    first connector slot on the edge.

14) Connect 3 more wires from the cable to the holes left vacant by the removal
    of the slide switch as shown.

                            (Sw2)

15) Connect the black lead of the cable (0V) to the far left slot on the PCB.
    This slot is connected to all the other slots on the left of the fire
    button.

16) Re-install the fire button, the PCB, and the screws.

17) Reconnect the leads from the joystick handle to the PCB, in the same
    positions as they were originally.

18) Position the pot plate over the joystick mechanism. Use 2 of the cover
    screws to hold it in place

19 Plug the joystick into the vectrex, and use the joystick test in the
   diagnostic ROM to test it.

20 Cut a slot in the left side of the cover to allow the fine trim control to
   protrude. Copy this slot from the one on the right side, and file down the
   lower part of the cover in a similar way.

21) Use a couple of cable ties to make a strain-relief to hold the cable in the
    slot in the joystick body.

22) Remove the screws you fitted to hold the pot plate in place, fit the cover,
    and secure it with the 4 screws.
