The following document appears to be a production plan for the partly
implemented Vectrex II.  From what I gather, the Vectrex II was a plain
Vectrex with new executive code (it can do lower case letters which the
Vectrex can't), a light pen, a port hacked on to communicate with a box
which drives a raster display and some type of computer module.

Accompanying this document were 4 slightly different Vectrex II demo
ROMs which will shortly be uploaded to the archives.  They all contain
the following text.  I have not tried to run this on my regular Vectrex
yet but I think it will at least display the text although not properly
as all lower case letters will show up as special graphics (or perhaps
not at all).

VECTREX II

INTELLIGENT DISPLAY
-------------------

October 1983

[Page 2]

Background
----------

GCE is a subsidiary of the Milton Bradley Company.

Principal product is Vectrex, a video game system.  Differentiated from
competitive systems by:

   - Use of vector scan rather than raster scan technology to generate
     images, which are faster and require less memory;

   - A self-contained CRT display.

Patent application has been filed on unique method of generating vector
images.

Experience with display technology has lead to development of two new
displays.

[Page 3]

Purpose
-------

To present two new displays which have significant implications for the
word processing industry for your review.

   - Display A combines vector and raster technology to combine high
     resolution, free-flowing imagery with character generation

   - Display B uses raster technology to provide character generation
   efficiently

A. Vector/Raster Display
   ---------------------

   Method:        Combine vector and raster technologies to produce high
                  resolution, free-flowing imagery with character
                  generation

   Advantages:    Primarily in use of vector scan technology to generate
                  images and combine these with raster generated text.
                  Provides high resolution images with a minimum of
                  instruction; thus, reducing program time, and storage
                  area required to refresh the image on the display.
                  Efficient use of memory results in high drawing speed
                  at low cost.  Combines these images effectively and
                  efficiently with raster generated text.

   Applications:  Display drawings and printed text simultaneously.
                  Valuable for engineering drawings, computer aided
                  design, instruction manuals, learning materials,
                  diagnostic uses, etc.

B. Raster Display
   --------------


   Method:        Uses raster technology to generate large numbers of
                  characters efficiently

   Advantages:    System generates 4800 characters (80 columns by 60
                  lines) and in sharp focus at low cost

   Applications:  Primarily in word processing.  User has the advantage
                  of seeing the full page of text displayed.  Provides
                  opportunity for final review, editing prior to
                  printing.  Results in improved quality of work, time
                  saving.
