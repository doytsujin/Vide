In late September of 1996 I received some unbelievable email from Robert
Van den Heuvel.  It seems that Robert's father used to work for GCE and
was privy to a lot of the Vectrex phenomenon.  Since his father knew
Robert liked to play video games, he brought home whatever was brewing
in the lab for Robert to play.  Luckily, Robert held on to most of it
and has agreed to let me have it.  The main part of the agreement is
that I make available whatever information I can cull together out of
all the stuff available for everyone and that is exactly what I am
doing.  The next few postings which start out with "[Vectrex] new
info:" are all part of the stuff that I have received from Robert and his
father.  I hope you find it as fascinating as I have.  Look forward in the
near future to such incredible finds as:

Four Vectrex II prototype demo ROMs
scans of:
   the front of a Minestorm II prototype cartridge
   special clear plastic light pen used for demos and trade shows
   official Vectrex console "publicity photo"
   official Vectrex 3D Imager "publicity photo"
   the entire summer 1983 owners club magazine "Passport"
   promotional flyers sent to dealers
   low quality picures of 2 different point-of-purchase display units
   parital full color label art for Dark Tower and Batter Up (name icons)
   AND MUCH MORE!!!


I cannot thank Robert and his father enough for being willing to so
generously part with such rare vestiges of everybody's (particularly my)
favorite classic game system!  Hooray for them!!!
