Los Angeles, CA, January 7, 1984 - General Consumer Electronics, a
subsidiary of the Milton Bradley Company, is helping in the
establishment of learning centers at major children's museums around the
country.

The Children's Museum concept allows children the chance to get a
"hands-on" educational experience.  The Vectrex, when used with its
Light Pen and allied software, has added a whole new dimension to each
museum's program.  The software is designed to provide children with a
non-threatening computer experience, as well as teaching the basics of
music, drawing, animation and spatial relationships.

GCE is currently working with 9 facilities, including the Load Angeles
Children's Museum, the San Diego Children's Museum and the Children's
Museum in Indainapolis, the largest children's museum in the world.
