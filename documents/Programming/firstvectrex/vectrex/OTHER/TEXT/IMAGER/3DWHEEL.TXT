                 SOME VECTREX 3D GOGGLE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

The accompanying files 3dplacement.gif and 3dwheel.gif show details of
the positioning of the wheel in the goggles and a generic wheel. Actual
wheels have varying amounts of red, green, and blue areas that correspond
to the relative amounts of each of these colors in the associated game.

As seen from the viewpoint of the wearer, the wheel turns counter-
clockwise.

There aren't any mirrors in the goggles.  There is a clear plexiglass
viewport for each eye, and the front of the goggles is clear plexiglass
also.  No mirrors.

I don't think it is very critical what kind of motor you use.  I think the
Vectrex will compensate for individual variances.  Probably.  I think...

The color wheel has a rather wide thick-plastic center section.  This has a
square hollow-wall receptacle into which a matching square protrusion on
the motor axle fits.  On the other side of the color wheel is a round boss
which fits into a non-turning receptacle which acts as a pivot point,
allowing the color wheel to be turned by the motor.  See the 3DCOLORW.GIF
to illustrate this.  Probably.  I think... :]

I don't know of any plans available for the goggles, nor a layout.  As for
the LED/phototransistor, see the GIF for placement.  In the goggles, they
are separated by about 3/4" (2 cm).

The wheels are fairly simple: the transparent part is about 1/64" (.5 mm). 
The thicker opaque center section is about 3/32" (3 mm). 

I was told by a fellow that it should not be so hard to manufacture the
wheel yourself. Look at the drawings of the wheels in the archive at the
vectrex site. Then go to a photo shop and order "KODAK GELATIN FILTER"

Blue =#47    CAT 149-5787
Green=#58    CAT 149-5860
Red  =#25    CAT 149-5605

These are the right colors but very thin. Then buy some thin plexiglass and
glue them on the plexiglass.  

> Also, I wondered if I could use 1/4 watt resistors instead of 1/8 watt. 
> Do you think it may work as well ?

I think the wattage is not critical here; the 1/8 watt parts were probably
used for size and cost.  Probably.  I think...
