*       Notes on the production of music using the Vectrex music routines.

*       Each beat can have up to three voices.  The notes are listed together,
*       each but the last having its sign bit set.  There follows a duration.
*       It would appear that silence has a note value of 63.  One thing that
*       remains to be determined is how to produce new attacks while sustaining
*       other voices.  Apparently this is accomplished simply by letting the
*       envelop sustain a voice while another attack begins.

*       This early attempt turned out to be an exercise in manually
*       transcribing music (which I don't read well anyway) and typing.
*       The careful listener will detect at least two errors in my
*       transcription.
