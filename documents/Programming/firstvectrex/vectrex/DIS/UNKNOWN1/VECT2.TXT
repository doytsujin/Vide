octagons.  FYI, "SETDP" is a directive for the assembler I use so it not
only won't bitch about "<address" DP references, but it will automatically
handle them as well.  Plus it makes the code a bit more readable by
making DP register changes more visible.

*               the origin point at the left end of the topmost line.
*
*               Note that they come out brighter than the longer lines,
*               probably because the lines are being drawn in a constant
*               time period (which would be the scale factor).  Hopefully
*               this effect is only visible with the longest of lines.
