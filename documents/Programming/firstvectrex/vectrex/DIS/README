Here you will find all kind of homebrew stuff.
Sources, tools etc. all for vectrex.

Sometimes there are sub directories called:

ORIGINAL

and 

NEW

and

BIN

In "ORIGINAL" are the files I originally found on the internet.
In "NEW" are the same files edited by me to provide some compatability to my current environment.
In "BIN" I will place all binaries of vectrex files.
