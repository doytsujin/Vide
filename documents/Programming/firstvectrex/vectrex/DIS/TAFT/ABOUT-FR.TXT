Subject: 6809 Disassembler

When I first got my Vectrex, I spent Thanksgiving weekend writing a
disassembler for the 6809.  I then dumped the contents of several of
the games (including the built-in OS/minestorm rom), and ran them
through the disassembler; worked like a champ!  Then I began the task
of interpreting what I saw.  I actually succeeded in reverse engineering
the following games:

   Art Master
   Mine Storm
   Star Castle
   OS and utilities
   Memory map of OS and Mine Storm usage

I even went so far as building a plug-in card for my HP Integral Computer,
which also attached to the Vectrex.  I could compile my tests on the
Integral, download the bits to the card, and then turn on the Vectrex;
worked great!  The assembler I was using I picked up for free off of the
net, and it had a few bugs.  Unfortunately, none of this stuff has been
touched for probably 8 years.
