Everything in here is music in the IBM-PC BASIC PLAY statement format.
Elsewhere I have a program for converting these things into Vectrex
cartridges, which will then play the given tunes.  The program presently
assumes an actual Vectrex interface, but could easily be modified to
write out the cartridge to a file directly.
