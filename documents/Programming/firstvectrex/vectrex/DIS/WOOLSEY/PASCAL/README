These Pascal programs are generally intended for use under CP/M Turbo
Pascal Ver 3.0 or so, with a Vectrex interface.   The include modules
DRAWLINE and VECDRAW are nominally the same, they just interface
different hardware.  VECDRAW is the implementation for using the
Vectrex+interface as the graphics display device.  DRAWLINE is the
draphics display routines for the console display, which uses "sixel"
graphics.

There are also some utility programs, and some quick-and-dirty data
conversion programs.  Most of the latter were for obtaining the linear
list of PLAY strings from the BASIC programs that originally contained
them.

The Pascal programs should be fairly easily modified to write cartridge
contents to a file rather than the Vectrex interface.

I never did get around to playing with the 3-D stuff, other than the DNA
thing.

Don't panic too much over the stuff in .lbr files; some of these 
programs contain code to read them.
