I changed some of the programs to compile with the Turbo Pascal
version I dug out from somewhere.
Not every program was changed, all changed done are commented with
something like (* malban *)

Some programs I didn't touch at all (yet)

Of the programs I touched, I compiled a working (semi) *.com file.
