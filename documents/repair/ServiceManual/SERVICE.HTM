		The HP3000 is a microprocessor based, vector scan system using
		a standard 9&quot; black &amp; white CRT as its video display device. The
		microprocessor (MPU) is the Motorola 66A09 device. The MPU operates
		at 1.6 MHz from a 6 MHz external Xtal. An Internal divide by 4
		circuit generates the MPU 1.6 MHz &quot;E&quot; clock signal used in the
		system. Program memory is stored in the 8K x 8 bit 2363 type ROM.
		This ROM contains common subroutines. the &quot;executive&quot; or assembler

		8 bit peripheral ports which interfaces the MPU with peripheral
		devices and external signals. One of the PIA ports Interfaces
		the General It Instrument AY-3-8912 sound-1.0. chip with the MPU

		<P><FONT FACE="Geneva" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><BR>
		DAC chip MC1408 receives an 8 bit word at data terminals 00-D7.
		DAC output (pin 4) is current source. One section of 10 LF353
		is used to change this current to a voltage representative of
		the 8 bit digital word received by the DAC chip. The LF353 voltage
		is applied to an input of the dual 4 channel multiplexer (MUX)
		Chip CD4052. This same voltage (designated &quot;DAC&quot; on the schematic)
		13 the X-axis drive signal.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Geneva" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><BR>
		The CD4052 MUX chip serves two purposes: It selectively Couples,
		under MPU control, the output %if the DAC current/voltage converter
		to one of 4 places and is used to selectively couple the inputs
		from the joystick pots to the voltage comparator IC LF353.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Geneva" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">Th e 4 places to which the &quot;DAC&quot; signal is coupled by the MUX

		</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Geneva" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000">The joystick pot positions are sensed by a successive approximation
		process. The MUX chip selects each joystick pot input line and
		applies it to the plus input of comparator IC LF353. At the same
		time the MPU generates digital wards that are changed to voltages
		by the DAC and current/voltage converter mentioned previously.
		These voltages are successfully applied to the comparator's minus
		input until the MPU generated voltage 13 equal to the joystick
		voltage. The MPU then recognizes the digital word representative
		of the comparison voltage and Is able to establish a location
		for the joystick pot, The present position for each joystick pot
		is sensed in this manner. The pot position Information is updated
		on a regular basis by the MPU.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Geneva" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><BR>
		Returning to the 4 and Y axis drive signals, these signals are
		applied to X,Y integrator IC LF347 negative Input pins through
		series analog switch types 4066B. The &quot;zero&quot; reference signal
		is applied to the positive inputs of the Integrators. There are
		also analog switches across the integrator IC capacitors. The
		series analog switches are controlled by MPU signal RAMP and the
		parallel capacitor switches are controlled by MPU signal Zero
		10. RAMP 10 determines when and for how long the X and Y axis
		voltage levels will be applied to the integrator amps. Zero 10
		is used to discharge the X &amp; Y axis integrator caps thus Initializing
		them for the next signal to be integrated.</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT FACE="Geneva" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"><BR>
		The outputs of the X,Y axis integrators are coupled through J-FET
		switches to IC LM379 deflection amplifiers. The LM379 operates
		as a voltage to current driver. the current through the deflection
		coils forming the electromagnetic field which deflects the CRT
		beam. To protect the CRT from spot burn in the event of a loss
		of deflection, the Y axis drive amplifiers output 13 detected
		and a deflection enable/disable signal generated. This signal
		controls the J-FET switches In series with the X,Y deflection
		amp inputs to reduce the scan drive signal in the event of a software
		or hardware failure plus discrete transistor type 2SC1921 operates
		to bias off the CRT.</FONT></P>

		Conventional full wave rectification and three terminal regulators
		are used in the low voltage power supply. A special negative DC
		source is generated by a voltage double-circuit which is used
		to supply a 13V to the DAC chip.</FONT></P>
