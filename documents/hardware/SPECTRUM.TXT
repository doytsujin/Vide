Mathis was the first to implement a working emulation
of this 'game'.

Thanks go to him and to Bruce Tomlin.

  RA+A Spectrum I+

  The Spectrum I+ was a modified Vectrex. It had a 32K ROM cart
  and 2K additional battery backed RAM (0x8000 - 0x87ff). PB6
  was used to signal inserted coins to the VIA. The unit was
  controlled by 8 buttons (2x4 buttons of controller 1 and 2).
  Each button had a LED which were controlled through writes to
  0xa000. The srvice mode can be accessed by pressing button
  8 during startup. As soon as all LEDs light up,
  press 2 and 3 without releasing 8. Then release 8 and
  after that 2 and 3. You can leave the screen where you enter
  ads by pressing 8 several times.

A company called Roy Abel & Associates also commercially exploited the
Vectrex by using it as a text terminal (which is about the worst thing
it can do) to perform the "Luscher Color Test" after you put a quarter
into a coin device which activated the unit.  You would pick colors in
the order that they appealed to you (again, why did they use a black and
white display for this job?), and it would tell you about your
personality.  Actually, no matter what you picked it would tell you
something that you could identify with; all of the statements were
pretty vague.  The guy that programmed it did not understand the
hardware; the text scrolled up the screen, but lines popped on at the
bottom and disappeared near the top instead of scrolling on and off from
offscreen.  Roy had GCE's permission and blessing to do the project.  In
fact, some former WT personnel (Sidleys and others) as well as Lee
Chaden (big sasaguy at GCE) were at Abel & Associates at the time.

To enter letters in the service Mode use following pattern:
All letters are 'written' using to button strokes.
Sort of an octal-system:

Keys

1+1  = '0'
1+2  = '1'
1+3  = '2'
1+4  = '3'
1+5  = '4'
1+6  = '5'
1+7  = '6'
1+8  = '7'

2+1  = '8'
2+2  = '9'
2+3  = 'A'
2+4  = 'B'
2+5  = 'C'
2+6  = 'D'
2+7  = 'E'
2+8  = 'F'

and so on...
