  GIF-format graphics detailing the color wheels used for the respective
  games. The color wheels pop into the 3-D goggles to provide both the
  3-D effect (by alternating blocking each eye from seeing the Vectrex
  screen) and color (by being composed of distinct red, green, and blue
  regions). The wheel for each 3-D game has unique amounts of red, green,
  and blue depending on how much of each color the specific game uses (if
  a game is designed to display mainly red lines, then the red portion of
  the wheel is larger).

  NOTE: CrazyCoaster and NarrowEscape use identical color wheels. The
  wheel for MineStorm is unique, however.
