<H2>Microprocessors Lecture 1</H2>
<H3>Aims of the course</H3>
<OL>
<LI>To teach the way in which a stored program digital computer
operates using the Motorola 6809 processor as an example.</LI>
<LI>To show how simple computer systems can be designed using
               memory and interface integrated circuits.</LI>
<LI>To enable students to write programs in 6809 machine and
               assembly code for simple control tasks.</LI>
<LI>To show how microprocessor design has developed to produce
               more powerful devices such as 68000 on the one hand and
               single-chip systems on the other.</LI>
</OL>
<hr>
<H3>Lectures</H3>
17 lectures on microprocessor design and interfacing<br>
3 lectures on advanced microprocessor techniques
<H3>Tutorials</H3>
10 tutorials will look at practical problems arising
           from labwork, practical interfacing circuits, programs etc
<H3>Labwork</H3>
4 lab sessions - the first will be for the whole class working in
groups.  Remaining three sessions will be timetabled throughout
the day with students working individually.
<P>
 Lab time is limited, so in order to complete the work you will
 have to be well prepared.  This means working through the
 programming exercises <FONT COLOR=RED>in advance</FONT> so that you are reasonably sure
 each program will work first time.
<hr>
<CENTER>
<FONT COLOR=RED SIZE=+1><B>*** Marks will only be given for labwork which is 
written in a proper lab book ***<br>
*** and which is verified by a
member of staff or demonstrator on the lab day ***</B></FONT>

<hr>
<H3>Books</H3>
There are hundreds of books on microprocessors - many of
which are good - but not many cover the M6809 and M68000.
<P>
Two which do are:-
<UL>
<LI>           Introduction to Microprocessors:      Using the MC6809 and
               MC68000 - Ralph Horvath published by McGraw Hill.  
	       <FONT COLOR=RED>NB The 2nd edition does
               not cover the M6809.</FONT>
<LI>
               Computers and Microprocessors - A C Downton published by Van
               Nostrand Reinhold (2nd Edition).  One of the Tutorial Guides
               in Electronic Engineering series.  
	       <FONT COLOR=RED>NB The 3rd edition does not cover the M6809.</FONT>
</OL>
Since the above books may not be commonly available in older editions (even though 
they are preferred) the following book contains a general overview of the course
material and additionally includes an introduction to logic design and the use
of signals in the digital domain.  This additional material is outside the scope
of this course.
