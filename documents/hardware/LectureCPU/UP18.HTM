Microprocessors from the major manufacturers possess a family resemblance.
<P>
Motorola entered the 8-bit microprocessor market with the 6800 processor.

<P>
Microcontrollers, such as the 6801, result in a very low chip count
since the CPU, RAM, ROM and I/O are on the one device.
<P>
Mention should also be made of the 8048 family of devices as they
are quite common.

<H3>16/32 bit processors</H3>
From the 8-bit processors, most manufacturers introduced 16-bit devices.

<H3>Advantages of 16-bit processors</H3>
Since the data bus is 16-bits wide, 2 bytes are read or written to
each memory cycle.   Therefore data transfers are faster for a
given bus speed.
<P>
As technical designs moved forward, extra logic was possible on-chip.
This was used to provide extra registers, instruction logic and
interrupt and bus handling.
<P>
In the same way, more address lines were added to the processor,
so that 16 Mbyte address space became common, compared to the
64 kbyte limit of 8-bit processors.
<P>
Architectures were developed to make register to register transfers
more common than in 8-bit designs.
