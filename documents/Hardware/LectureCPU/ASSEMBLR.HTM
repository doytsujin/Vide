<H3>Notes on using the M6809 assembler in the lab</H3>

<OL>

<LI>Prepare the source file using the Editor program in the usual way. The filename

should be given the extension <B>.asm</B> (e.g. test.asm).  

The format must be as given

below - if there is no label on a line there must be at least 

one space character

preceding the instruction mnemonic.

<PRE>

                                  org     $3000

                                  ldx     #$C646

                          loop    leax    -1,x

                                  bne     loop

                                  swi

                                  end

</PRE>

Note that assembler directives do not have a dot preceding them and to obtain the

# symbol it may be necessary to use the "pound" key (shift-3).



<LI>Exit from the editor and type <B>asmset</B> to set up a path to the 

directory in which the assembler is stored.  

The source program is assembled by giving the command

<B>asm6809</B> followed by the filename.  

In order to generate a file containing a listing

of the source and object programs it is necessary to give the command in the

form below:-

<PRE>

                          asm6809 test.asm -l > test.lst

</PRE>

This redirects the output listing to a file called test.lst which can then be listed or

printed.



<LI>Errors in the source program can be corrected using the editor and then the

program can be re-assembled using the procedure in (2).  Do not use the machine

code from a listing which contains errors as these may invalidate code even if it

appears to be correct.



<LI>The assembler has a tendency to use direct page addressing. To ensure that

extended addressing is used prefix the address with >.

<PRE>

                          e.g.   lda   >$fe00

<H3>Notes on downloading assembled programs in the lab</H3>

<OL>

<LI>When you have successfully assembled a program the assembler automatically

creates an S19 file.  

This is a file which contains the machine code version of your

program in a special format known as S records which includes all the instruction

bytes together with address information and error checking bytes.  The name of

this file will be the same as the file you assembled but with a <B>.s19</B> extension.  

I.e. if you assemble <B>test.asm</B> a file <B>test.s19</B> will be produced.  

This is the file which will be downloaded to the lab-kits.



<LI>Two programs are required to download the S19 file, one running on the PC and

one on the lab-kit.  

To run the program on the PC type <B>asmset</B> to set up a path to

the directory where the program is located, then <B>download</B> to run the 

downloading program.

The settings for the serial link are displayed and you are requested to type the

name of the file to be downloaded.  

Type the name <B>without</B> the S19 extension.  

If the file exists the download program asks you to press any key to start

transmission.  <B>Do not do this yet.</B>



<LI>Make sure the serial link from the PC is plugged into the correct 

connector on the lab-kit.  

This is the <B>left-hand</B> connector viewing the <B>kit from the front.</B>



<LI>On the lab-kit, make sure the normal prompt is displayed <B>Cmd/Add></B> 

and start running the program by typing <B>E5C0 G</B>. 

The screen will go blank.



<LI>Press any key on the PC to start the process. 

A dot will be displayed for each byte sent.  

If the file is transferred successfully the PC will display an appropriate

message and the lab-kit will display <B>Trans O.K.</B> 

before returning to command mode.  

If an error occurs the lab-kit will display <B>Trans Error.</B>  

In this case the procedure should be repeated.
