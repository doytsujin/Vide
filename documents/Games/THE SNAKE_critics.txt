THE SNAKE
The game is an adapation of the "snake" theme.
As in other snake games you are not allowed to touch the walls - you die as soon as this happens.

I find the "menu system" annoying.
The game starts right away when the cartridge is loaded - ok (no menu - I can live with that).
But after you die (which will inevitably be just as you start the game) - RIGHT away the next game starts.
But within the play area the GAME OVER letters are written (and also the score - which by the way is buggy -
since always ZERO).

While the text is displayed (and the screen updates are down to one half) the snake already moves again and you have
to steer it - otherwise you jump from one game over to the next.

As if that is not bad enough - ingame, after you reach a certain length you enter the next "level"
(snake shortened - speed goes up) - here the same!
Some cycle eating text is displayed - you start at full speed with a new snake. And after the text disappears
(since screen updates now are really fast (no text + short snake) - you almost certainly crash against a wall.
(for me - 3 out of 4 times) which makes it nearly unplayable.

Technically:
- displaying game over and level increase IN Game is a terrible idea - the speed difference
  between only small snake (50Hz) and the +text version (25Hz) is half!
- in addition to that the screen refresh can get really hurtfull with a long snake
- the above mentioned "intensity" (bug)
- basic sound

General vectrex game: 3.5/10 (although I like the graphics better than from THE HUNGRY PYTHON)
For a first vectrex game: 6.5/10
