HURDLES
This is a sports game - you have to jump hurdles!

The presentation of the game is very good!
When you start the game you see a little intro of a guy running over hurdles
and a hint of a reward ceremony.
The game continues to go to a selection title screen (with animated hurdles on top).

It feels "Track and Field"ish - great!
Within the menu you can chose different game modes - and there even are 9 pages
of instructions.

The competition mode sports different "lengths" of disciplines
first 110m than 400m and than 1000m (where I was disqualified).
After the competition you are rewarded with a nice little ceremony display.

You can controll the guy using the buttons.
Button 3 is jump - the longer you press the higher he jumps.
(Is it on purpose, that while in the air I can jump again - and thus keep him
in the air quite some time?)
(Is it on purpose, that while "jumping" and one touches the joystick, that he
immediately falls down?)

The actual runnning feels (for a sports game) quite slow - but if it were
faster the controls would probably prove more fatal than they are (you have
to press the button pretty exactly).

The instruction is sometimes false, since (at least there I noticed) - within the
1000m run the "meters" do display the number of hurdles taken, not the meters!

Technically:
- screen refresh is quite low for the amount of vectors display (about 30 Hz)
(this is probably due to the Strings displayed)
- the controls (see above) sometimes feel a bit buggy
- basic sound

General vectrex game: 4/10 (could also be much better - the whole game feels "to slow" for me actually - sport should be ACTION)
For a first vectrex game: 7/10
