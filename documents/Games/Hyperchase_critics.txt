Hyperchase Auto Race (GCE 1982) C+

I don't know why this game is called "Hyperchase", since there's really no chasing to speak of. Colecovision fans will recognize this game's likeness to Turbo, and Atari 2600 players will probably see a little bit of Enduro in this. It's a point-of-view racing game where you see the action from above and just behind your car. This gives you a good vantage point of the road ahead and oncoming cars. Two playing modes allow you to race for either points or best time. I was surprised how well this game conveys the sensation of speed. Tree, telephone poles, and street lights whiz by smoothly, and you even drive through a tunnel at one point. The road never actually bends, but by altering your perspective of the action, the game actually gives the illusion of curves. Although the road and scenery is smoothly animated, the other cars are not. They move in a jumpy manner, especially when several are on the screen at once. Poor collision detection is often the result, as other cars tend to pass right through yours, or worse, hit you from out of nowhere. The controls are a bit sensitive, and it's very easy to slam into the side of the road. In addition, it's difficult to shift (using the 1 and 2 buttons) while trying to steer. As far as the sound goes, the hum of your motor is realistic, especially when you switch gears. Hyperchase is an impressive looking game, but the sloppy animation really holds it back.
