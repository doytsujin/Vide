TRAFFIC RACE
This is presented as a racing game - although I would say its a "dodge" game.
You drive on a road and must not get hit by other cars.

The game has a very good presentation, there are mountains in the background and trees on
both sides of the road which "scroll" (zoom) by.
The overlay is great and fits the scenario.

The game offers three different difficulty settings - which I find even on easy
quite hard (the difference is only the count of lives).

Funny:
- The instruction mentions a "Star Castle Cartridge" - a little bit to much copy/paste :-)

Technically:
- the explosion is somewhat "strange" it takes huge amounts of cycles
- after a death the "lives" are displayed a little bit to long for my taste
- basic (explosion) sound
- refresh rate is actually very good (except explosion) about 50Hz!

General vectrex game: 6/10
For a first vectrex game: 9/10
