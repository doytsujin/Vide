This game requires the Vectrex 3D Imager goggles. You must climb aboard the Crazy Coaster and get ready for a roller coaster ride more dangerous and exciting than any you've experienced before! You will find yourself leaning into every curve.
I can't describe the game better than they did in the manual where they say "You control the movements of the passenger in the lead car as he plummets down the spectacularly steep hills and careens around the gravity-defying curves of the Crazy Coaster. Will you be able to keep his arms raised throughout the ride without sending him flying off into space?" Raising your arms during the ride earns bonus points.
This is a kind of a stretch to call it a game, but the 3D experience gives the game play for this cartridge rates 6-10, controls 7-10, and overall 6-10. It is great 3D experience that doesn't have a lot of substance behind it.
