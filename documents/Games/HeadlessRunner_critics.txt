HEADLESS RUNNER
You run on some sort of way and must either jump low, high or dodge obstacles. The longer you last the
higher the score.

The main character is rudimentary animated, which is nice and quite sufficient for the game.
The game has two different modes which vary slightly in speed and approaching objects.

The game actually might be fun - but there are bugs, which may - or may not hinder gameplay.
I have not looked too hard to find them, but they seem to be two fold:

a) some obstacles are not drawn correctly (or are not generated at all). On a real vectrex there is
only one short line visible - but you do not get a score and can also not fail
(but within the flow of the game it is obvious - obstacles ARE missing, sometimes quite a few after another)
b) randomly - but mostly after a "reset" (selecting player 2) the system crashes

Technically:
- the highscore is displayed alongside the current score - I like that
- screen update speed is ok
- basic sound
- I don't like the bugs (see above)

General vectrex game: 3/10
For a first vectrex game: 6/10
