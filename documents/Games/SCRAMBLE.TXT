Scramble 
--------
   Watch out for that next mountain!  Maneuver your ship over a rough terrain
in an effort to destroy the enemy base.  Careful piloting alone won't get you
to your destination... you must brave rockets, UFOs, flamoids and some very
tight tunnels.  Few people have ever seen the enemy base, let alone destroy
it.  Will you be one of the select few?

Game Play
---------
   Your ship will immediately come into view and the landscape of the first
part of your journey will begin moving beneath you.  Use the joystick to
maneuver your ship across the terrain, avoiding the mountains and other
obstacles.  Press button 3 to drop bombs.  Press button 4 to fire lasers at
the obstacles.  If you are successful in piloting through that section of the
terrain, you will immediately fly to the next, more difficult part of the
planet.  If you successfully travel through all levels, you will eventually
reach the enemy base.

Joystick
--------
   The joystick lets you control the ship's height and speed.  Push the
joystick up and down to control how high you are flying.  By moving the
joystick right and left, you can control the speed.  You can also move
diagonally.  You cannot move any further back then the left side of the
screen.

Objects Found on Journey
------------------------
   The various obstacles you will encounter as you head toward the enemy base
include:

Missiles-       [Obvious- they will launch up at you sometimes.]
Fuel Tanks-     [Boxes on two legs.]
Mystery Bases-  [Big box with an X in it.]
UFOs-           ["Bowl-shaped."  Have vertical symmetry.]
Flamoids-       [Almost triangles.  Have horizontal symmetry.]

Levels
------
   There are five levels in Scramble which you must survive in an effort to
get to the enemy base.  The levels are as follows:

LEVEL ONE:   The Mountains.
             Fly over a mountainous terrain, destroying obstacles.  Maneuver
             carefully... surface-to-air missiles will be constantly
             released.

LEVEL TWO:   The Cavern.
             Weave your way through a treacherous cavern.  Be sure to avoid
             the floor and ceiling while also avoiding or destroying the
             UFOs.

LEVEL THREE: The Flamoids.
             Careful piloting is required to survive this level.  Flamoids
             are speeding toward you and your bullets and lasers have no
             effect on them -- you can only try to avoid this danger.

LEVEL FOUR:  The City.
             Climb high over the walls of the city.  Watch carefully because
             missiles hidden in silos may take off and destroy you at any
             moment.

LEVEL FIVE:  The Maze.
             This tight maze requires absolute precision to survive.  The
             fuel tanks at the beginning are your last chance to fuel up
             before tackling the enemy base.

LEVEL SIX:   The Enemy Base.
             Your only objective is to bomb the enemy base.  This level will
             repeat until the base is successfully destroyed.

Fuel
----
   The fuel gauge is at the bottom of the screen.  Each of your ships will
start with a full tank and you can add fuel by destroying the fuel tanks with
bombs or lasers.  Each fuel tank is worth 1/8 of your tank.  If you start to
run low, your fuel gauge will flash and a warning signal will sound.  If you
do run out of fuel, your ship will crash.

Collisions
----------
   If you collide with the landscape or any obstacle, you will lose one ship. 
You will automatically return to the beginning of the level you were on.

Bombing the Enemy Base
----------------------
   Once the enemy base is hit, the Scramble them is played and the difficulty
of the game is increased further.  You will get a full tank of fuel and will
automatically advance to LEVEL ONE again.

Number of Ships
---------------
   In each game you start with 5 ships.  A bonus ship is awarded when you
score 10,000 points.

Scoring
-------
   As long as you are flying you are awarded 10 points every second.  You are
also awarded points for destroying obstacles.  The obstacles, their point
values and the levels in which they appear are as follows:

     Obstacle                Points                Levels
   ---------------------------------------------------------
     Missile (on ground)        50                 1,2,3,4
     Missile (in air)           80                 1,4
     Fuel Tank                 150                 1,2,3,4,5
     Mystery Base              200                 1,2,3,4
     UFO                       100                 2
     Enemy Base                850                 6
