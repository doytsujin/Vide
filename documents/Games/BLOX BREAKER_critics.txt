BLOX BREAKER
A breakout clone.

The ball moves hoizontally faster than the player - this ensures the player must do a bit
of forward thinking and calculation - not to bad.

Collision detection is sometimes a bit croocked - and I also had the ball bouncing "downward" from the player
(and thus losing a ball [player has 3 to start with]).

The higher the levels - the more blocks are visible - this means there is a dramatic drop in the framerate
(below 15 Hz). This makes the game sometimes hard to the eyes - but also a bit easier (since slower).

There is rudimentary sound support.

Technical:
- refresh rate is low to very low (10-25 Hz)
- rudimentary sound support
- collision detection sometimes "off"
- ball also sometimes drawn in blocks

General vectrex game: 3.5/10
