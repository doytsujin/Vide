Right now all that exists of  this is just a very rough quick de-make of the Flappy Bird concept, which shouldn't be considered a playable finished game, and some half finished routines and plans for improvement.. The Flappy-Bird De-Make was originally just done as a bit of a joke, but I think it played OK for a quick mash-up... I originally knocked the 'Flappy Bird' de-make out in just a couple of nights ( 5ish hours work) and no optimisation, or play testing, has been done to this code at all!
So what you get is a very rough demo program, not to be compared with the excellent 'Veccy Bird' flappy bird program already out there...
