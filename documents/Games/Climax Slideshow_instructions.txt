The Climax slideshow is a slideshow featuring the pixelart works of Menno Seegers (created between 1993 and 1996). The slideshow consists of a total of 15 fullscreen bitmap images, which have all been handpixeled in Deluxe Paint and then carefully converted to be displayed on the vectrex. I tried recreating the kind of slideshow as they were done in the early 90s (when these images where created), so no fancy effects this time around.
