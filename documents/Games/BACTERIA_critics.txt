BACTERIA
In this game you play the title giving bacteria. You must eat the food that appears randomly on
the screen to grow.

Actually - I like this game! It offers some diversity and computer opponents.

The game can be played in three modes.
Game 1: (more like training) you are alone and must eat the food that appears.
You grow and after a time limit there is an end :-).
Game 2 (and three also, more info in the instruction):
You have an opponent Bacteria, which also tries to eat the food. If you are larger than the
opponent - you can eat him vice versa.

What I find really great is, that with the numbers of players - you actually enter the number of
"enemy" Bacteria. So there is realy some action and avoiding going on.

The only thing missing for me is a little "intro" and some game over screen which shows your high score.
But overall - a great effort and an original concept.

Technically:
- with many players - the screen update suffers a little
- basic sound
- a "game over" would have been great!
