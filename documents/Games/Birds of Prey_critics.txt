John Dondzila is "the man" when it comes to bringing classic arcade games to the Vectrex, but this adaptation of Phoenix misses the mark somewhat.  As in the classic shooter, you face two stages of small birds, two stages of large birds, and finally the huge mother ship.  The first stage is tough because your missiles don't move very fast.  Fortunately, some of the birds can be taken out with your shield.  The second stage is my favorite because you can shoot twice as fast, making it easier to clear the screen.  Both of the large bird stages are pretty much identical.  But unlike the arcade game, you can't shoot their wings off, and you have to nail them DEAD CENTER in order to kill them.  These levels are long and tedious, but at least the birds split into meaty chunks.  The mother ship stage is a disappointment - it looks kind of junky.  Instead of shooting away at the hull, a huge hole already exists.  A fleet of birds is present to defend it.  It's nice to see a childhood favorite on the Vectrex, but this failed to rekindle the old nostalgia.
