BRICK CRUSHER
This is another breakout clone.

This is game is actually quite complete - in the sense that:
a) it has different levels, that "automatically" follow each other without user action
b) it has a "game over" screen which gives you some feedback
c) it has a "game finished" screen, which tells you that you did well.

The only drawback is, that the game only features 4 levels - but you can not have it all - can you?

In addition to the "normal" breakout - some bricks losen spikes, which fall down - you must
avoid them - which might prove tricky if you also have to hit the ball.

Technically:
- screen refresh can get really low - but on a real vectrex it is still bearable
- basic sound
- sometimes one of the "outer" (left or right) bricks seems to have a quite lose collision detection
- honorable mention - nice overlays!

General vectrex game: 6/10 (5 plus a bonus point for "completeness" :-))
For a first vectrex game: 9/10
