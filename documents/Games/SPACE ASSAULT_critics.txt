SPACE ASSAULT
This game is another "shoot'em up". You can move across the whole screen and shoot (upwards) different weapons:
a) a blaster (always, two shots needed)
b) torpedos (always, 1 shot needed)
c) BFG2k (can be collected for a certain time, for the "indestructable" enemies)
You have lifeforce which gets reduced when hit in some way.

There are "extras" you can catch as e.g. a shield (no damage) or extra health - or the BFG.

What I find a bit strange is, that it seems to be pointless to kill the aliens -
since obviously they die as soon as they hit the ground...

The instruction gives some side punches to other games (Quake - Farmville).
Also one of the aliens is called "JÃ¤ger" (German: hunter).

Technically
- there seems to be a bug in the game - since it tries to WRITE to a ROM location.
If write access to ROM is enabled in an emulator (or one tries to run the game on a vecFever,
which allows ROM access per default) the game crashes after some bad ROM writes.
On a real vectrex (card) this won't be noticable - but I wonder where these "writes" would belong
to in earnest!
- the game was saved with "RAM", therefor the binary won't run on a
vectrex (unless truncated)
- sound is supported
- the speed of the game is very good - most of the time 50Hz

General vectrex game: 6/10 (good game actually!)
For a first vectrex game: 9/10
