In a strange twist, the instructions for Tour De France seem to offer more questions than answers: "I'm sorry, but I do not know exactly what it takes to make it past a stage or the number of stages in the game.  It you find out please post the info in the rec.game.vectrex newsgroup."  I guess that's what happens when you resurrect a game 
17 years after it was written!  
As it is, Tour De France isn't half bad.  You view your biker from behind while speeding down a winding road that takes you around curves and over hills.  Your guy looks a lot like Kermit the Frog with those big, triangular feet (see original Muppet Movie).  There's some modest scenery in the form of passing trees, telephone poles, and rock walls.  The smooth-frame rate and undulating roads help convey a nice sense of speed.  You can shift between three gears, although the middle gear is the most playable by far.  You'll pass other bikers on the road, but your main concern should be those deadly banana peels! 
These things are all over the place, and just touching one will put your bike in a horizontal position.  Sometimes you can get into a rhythm and weave through the peels, but it seems like once you hit one, you hit five more in a row.  It doesn't help that your biker tends to block your view of the road.  One highly original feature of Tour De France is how you can grab water when your hydration meter runs low.  You'll spot an occasional water bottle on the side of the road, and pressing a button lets you reach out to it with your long, skeletal arm.  As far as I can tell, Tour De France contains one stage and the object is to complete it in the shortest time.  It's not a great game, but it gets points for originality.  I can't think of another game that's quite like this.
