Game Play
---------
   Your pirate-destroying ship will appear on the right side of the screen. 
In a two player game, a second pirate-destroying ship will appear on the left
side of the screen.  Your fuel cells will be in the center.  You must guard
your fuel cells from the pirates who will try to steal them.  The pirates can
appear from anywhere on the screen.  Steer your ship with either the joystick
or buttons 1 and 2, for left and right rotation.  Move your ship forward by
pressing button 3.  Press button 4 to fire lasers at the pirates.  The
pirates can be destroyed by colliding with them, but you will then have to
wait for your new pirate-destroying ship to appear before you can fire more
lasers.  The game is over when all the fuel cells are stolen.

The Pirates
-----------
   There are six types of pirates.  Each new type is faster and smarter. 
They can all steal fuel tanks and fire lasers at you.  In a one player game,
two pirates of the first type will appear.  If you destroy them, two pirates
of the second type will attempt to steal fuel cells, and so on.  After all
six pirates types appear, two at a time, they will start appearing three at a
time.  In a two player game, you start with six of each type of pirate,
appearing three at a time.

Getting Hit
-----------
   If you are hit by a pirate or collide with a pirate or the other ship (in
two player game only), you will disappear.  After a brief delay, you will
return from the side on which you first entered.

Scoring
-------
   Points are awarded for destroying each pirate, as follows:

                  Pirate 1  --  10 points
                  Pirate 2  --  20 points
                  Pirate 3  --  30 points
                  Pirate 4  --  40 points
                  Pirate 5  --  50 points
                  Pirate 6  --  60 points

   No points are awarded for destroying the other pirate-destroying ship (two
player game).

Bonus Points
------------
   After destroying all six types of ships you go to the bonus levels.  When
"Bonus + 10" appears on the screen, 10 additional points are earned for each
pirate destroyed.  After destroying 6 more pirate groups "Bonus + 20" will
appear.  The bonuses will continue to increase for each six pirate groups
destroyed.
