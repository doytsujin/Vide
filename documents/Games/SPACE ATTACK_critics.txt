SPACE ATTACK
A simple shoot em up. Player can move left and right and shoot enemies. There are 3 different enemie types.

The game playes ok and the screen refresh doesn't hurt the eyes to much. The score is visible all the time, so
the player knows where he stands.

Only two things that I find bothering:
a) you do not see in any way, when an enemy hits you (no explosion, no sound, no animation...)
b) you have five lives, but these are not displayed.

Both points taken together it feels "random" when the game over screen is shown - since you do not
always recognized when hit.

Technical:
- refresh rate is ok
- ships are good recognizable and "big"

General vectrex game: 4/10
For a first vectrex game: 8/10
