ARTILLERY STRIKE
This is (as the name suggests) an artillery clone - nowadays you might call it an "angry bird derivat" :-).
The game is pretty straight forward - angle your gun correctly to hit the enemy.

There is nothing much special going on, there is no two player variant.
Ten different levels of increasing difficulty (which must be chosen manually).
The in game music is taken from "Armor Attack" which is fitting.

Nice:
The angle of the gun seems to be correctly calculated on the fly!

Technically
- the WaitRecal routine is called multiple times per update round,
this makes the display more "shaky" than needed, since each call "waits" till
30000 cycles have passed (since last call)
- the ingame music is VERY repetitive
- personally I would have favoured joystick input for angles
- the above mentioned "intensity" (bug)
- the game was saved with "RAM", therefor the binary won't run on a
vectrex (unless truncated)

General vectrex game: 4/10
For a first vectrex game: 7/10
