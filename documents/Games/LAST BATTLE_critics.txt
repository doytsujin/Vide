LAST BATTLE
Another shoot em up. Enemies must be shot by a player moving at the bottom. The enemies approach in Galaga like fashion.
The player can not be harmed. A Level lasts till
a) either all enemies are destroyed (some require more than one shot)
b) the player is out of bullets (35)

Without overlay (and correctly placing it) the bullet meter can not easily be discerned (its just a dash at the top of the screen).
Why the author chose that a player must SELECT a level every single game instead of just going on to the next - is beyond me.

The game features nice large sprites and also rudimentary sound (shot/explosion).

Funny - there is misspelling in the instruction, where the enemy ships are called "sheeps" :-)

Technical:
- refresh is most of the time good - if you play a high level and have many bullets in the air - it drops
- fluid movement of ships, good control, good collision detection
- sound
- cool "animated" score at level over!
- overlay assumes all vectrex are alike (which is not the case), the small "bullet" section will certainly not
fit all vectrex equally

General vectrex game: 5/10
For a first vectrex game: 9/10
