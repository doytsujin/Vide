THE HUNGRY PYTHON
The game is an adapation of the "snake" theme.

Starting the game is sometimes tricky - since as "starter" the snake runs "thru" the walls, once you start steering you have to
avoid the screen edges. If you happen to start at the wrong time - you crash right into the wall - and game over!

Due to the lower screen refresh rate with a longer snake - it seems that the game gets easier the longer you play.
(up until the snake length suddenly resets - at 32 body "length")

Funny:
Pressing in game the "not occupied" button two plays a BIOS music tune.

Funny 2:
The manual explains a second control panel - but the game is single player.

Technically:
- the WaitRecal routine is called multiple times per update round,
this makes the display more "shaky" than needed, since each call "waits" till
30000 cycles have passed (since last call)
- in addition to that the screen refresh can get really hurtfull with a long snake
- the above mentioned "intensity" (bug) [only "in game" - in game mode 1 I got about 90 points befor it went all dark]
- basic sound
