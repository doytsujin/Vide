Storm storm storms storming stormingly!

In 2017, humanity learned nature's true wrath. It was no longer just storms. No, this was in a completely different dimension. A storm that throws storms - a Storm Storm.

You're our last hope. You must use the anti-storm-storm-storm-device to destroy all the storm storm storms, or everything you love will die.

Can you storm up to the task?

A brand new arcade-style game storming its way to the Vectrex in 2017!

(Storm Storm is one of my silly smaller games, so please don't go in expecting something grand, ok?)


Controls for Vectrex:

    Confirm - Button 1
    Jump with paddle - Button 1
