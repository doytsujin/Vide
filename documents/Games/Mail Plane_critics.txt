This game was made for use with the Vectrex Light Pen but was never released. Only a scant few prototype Mail Plane cartridges exist and I would love to get my hands on one, but odds are I never will. Even though I do not own a prototype, I am listing it here to remind me of just how cool it would be to add to my collection.
In this game you use the Vectrex Light Pen in conjunction with the Joystick Controller to plot a course to deliver packages to various cities in the United States then load them on the plane. Then the game becomes much like a flight simulator as you must take off, fly to your destination avoiding bad weather and land at your destination.
Judging by the videos of the fully working prototype I can surmise that the game play for this cartridge would probably rate 9-10, controls 7-10, and overall 8-10. One day I hope a working ROM comes out so that I can experience the game for myself.
