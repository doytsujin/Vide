ABSORBTEX
You move your ship around the screen and try to collect more fuel than the enemy in a given time frame.
The game allows you to chose the level you play (4 levels)

The ship can be moved with the joystick and rotated with the button

Technical:
- refresh can go REALLY low (below 15 Hz in higher levels)
- the enemy ships just move diagonal
- cool to see a rotation of the playership
