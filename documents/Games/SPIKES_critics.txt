SPIKES
A jump and run game, where you must reach the exit and not hurt yourself touching
any "spikes".

The game consists of only two levels - which I consider unfinished.

Technical:
- refresh rate is ok.
- the vectors of a level are drawn in one GO - on real vectrex the levels look
not 100% correct due to drift.
- the game binary was saved with the "RAM", the binary is larger than 50kb and thus
does not run on a vectrex. Truncating the file to a shorter than 32769KB size does work.
- the game over String line one is not terminated, which results in garbage on a real vectrex

General vectrex game: 2/10 (would be higher if there were more levels)
For a first vectrex game: 5/10
