ROBHOP
A little jump and run game, where you must collect "screws" to repair your robot.
To finish a level - collect the battery. Falling does not hurt.

Some collision detection seems to be "strange".
You can not die or death has no consequences (other than perhaps starting new)

The level must always be chosen from the main screen (even finishing a level does not
start the next level).

Game seems a bit unfinished.

Technical:
- screen refresh upon start = 12 Hz (nearly unbearable)
- nice overlay - although, overlay does assume, that all vectrex have the
same vector "layout" (which is not the case)

Conclusion:
In principal a fun little game - the screen refresh makes it nearly unplayable.

General vectrex game: 2/10
For a first vectrex game: 5/10
