HEXTREX
You must protect your (centered) base from incoming ships. You can move around the base (HEX) and shoot at the
incoming ships.

- The ship movement is strangely implemented you must push the joytick in the direction you
want to move and press button 1 - on the release of the button, the ship moves!
- Fire is button 2 - together with the movement - a major obstacle to master the game is
to learn the controls.
- very annoying after game over you must reset the vectrex to start another game!

Technical:
- refresh rate is quite low (20-25 Hz)

General vectrex game: 2/10 (the game and the idea is not bad, but the controls and reset to restart really bugs me)
For a first vectrex game: 5/10
