YASI (homebrew)

Alex Herbert from the U.K. is the guy programming more commercial Vectrex games than most other game developers at present. The magnificant Protector was released early in 2003 and the follow up games YASI was released in November 2003. Herbert's games really push the Vectrex to it's limits and this faithful Space Invaders clone is no exception.

 

Arcade Space Invaders was originally released by Taito in Japan and was programmed by Toshiro Nishikado in 1978. Space Invaders was the game which was instrumental in creating the videogame industry as we know it today. It involves manouvering a laser base left or right and shooting alien invaders, which congregate in rows, and utilising protective bunkers to aid you against enemy fire. But you allready knew that.

 

If you have received your copy of YASI in the mail from Mark Shaker you will know that the cartridge not only includes the re-released Protector but the packaging and cover art is up to scratch with, and even surpasses, the presentation of many other modern console games. Manu Parssinen, the cover artist, has really gone all out and his use of Photoshop in presenting a customized Vectrex console with Space Invaders artwork adds significantly to the games appeal.

 

YASI is about as close to Space Invaders as you can get and the invader who steals the 'C' from 'CCOIN' in the original also replaces the upside down 'Y' from 'YASI' in the games introduction screen is also present. YASI goes into my top 5 favourite Vectrex games. Keep up the good work Alex.

 

**Space Invaders caused a huge yen shortage in Japan in the early 80's. 

 

Score 9/10
