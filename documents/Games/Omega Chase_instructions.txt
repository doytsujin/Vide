Background

Omega Race was an arcade game where players flew around a limited playfield while destroying objects. Unlike many other games where collisions with walls would destroy a player's (/s') ship, players could bounce off of walls in Omega Race.

Omega Chase is a clone of Omega Race, which was a free download. Omega Chase Deluxe was the physical cartridge release of the game, which also included Zap.
Gameplay 
Omega Chase

The player(s) controls a ship in the Omega System. Fighters, Escorts and Freighters attack their ship and it's the player's job to destroy them first. They must avoid mines left by enemies and be careful when thrusting around the walls. Collision with either the enemies or their mines will result in losing a life.
Zap

The player controls the laser cannon on a space station while Bomber and Destroyers attack. The Bombers will send bombs on a collision course and the Destroyer will orbit the player's station. Action gets fast and faster, so the player's reflexes will need to as well. Miss a bomb and the player will lose a life.
