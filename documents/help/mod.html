<h1>Mod</h1>

<p>Mod to vectrex conversion is not an entirely trivial thing. Here a couple of notes:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>&larr;the orginal MOD has 4 voices (later versions can have even more than 4)</p>
</li><li>
<p>&rarr;vectrex only as 3 voices</p>
</li><li>
<p>&larr;MODs play samples</p>
</li><li>
<p>&rarr;although vectrex can be brought to play samples, it is not its "natural" cause (unlike theg good old Amiga), therefor vectrex will play generated sound after conversion (not samples)</p>
</li><li>
<p>&larr;because MODs play samples there is no way to "auto-map" one instrument (sample) to a PSG setting (something instrument like), since every MOD can have different samples</p>
</li><li>
<p>&rarr;not all samples have a "fitting" counterpart in vectrex "instruments".   </p>
</li></ul>

<p>Therefor:<br />
In order to achieve conversion results which are at least somewhat pleasing, you as a user have to help!</p>

<ol><li>
<p>You must tell which of the 4 voices are supposed to be matched to the three vectrex voices</p>
</li><li>
<p>You must tell which of the instruments(samples) of the MOD are mapped to what PSG settings [The vectrex mod-routines use the BIOS sound playing routines]</p>
</li></ol>

<p>(This might not be an easy task, since there are two stumbling blocks:
<ol><li>
<p>Mod writers often do not name their instruments very descriptive</p>
</li><li>
<p>You have to know how the vectrex sound routines work in order to find settings for "instruments")</p>
</li></ol>
