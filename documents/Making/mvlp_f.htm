      <td width="80%" height="120" align="left"> OK, since we want this thing 
        to fit inside a small marker casing, you can't use wirewrap sockets for 
        the components, so you'll have to solder the connections point-to-point 
        style. Just use the 30 AWG wirewrap wire to make these connections. If 
        you have two pins next to each other, you can usually take a discarded 
        lead from a resistor to bridge the small gap. Just be sure to clip off 
        any excess. I find it easiest to wire all of the GND connections first, 
        then the +5v connections. Work from right to left on this schematic. I'd 
        recommend starting at the source of power and working outward from there. 
        In this circuit I would start at the 47µF capacitor and work towards the 
        L14G3 phototransistor.</td>

        The first picture obviously shows the MVLP without the marker cap. Why 
        would you want to put the marker cap on there anyway? Well, try it, and 
        you'll see why. The first conclusion you'll come to is, &quot;Cool, it's 
        a marker again...and when I pop this cap off there's a totally rad lightpen 
        inside!&quot;. Umm, yeah. Well, maybe not... but the functional part I 
        hoped you'd see is the protective cover aspect. It keeps the dust out, 
        and keeps the tip of the marker case from getting mangled.</td>

        Don't forget to set your brightness properly. The official Vectrex lightpen 
        instructions suggest turning down the brightness from MAX. until the dot 
        in the center of the screen just goes away. You'll find that this is still 
        a little too bright for the MVLP, which is a good thing because you don't 
        have to blast your eyes with day-bright vectors just to get your MVLP 
        to work adequately. You can get a good sense of the sensitivity of the 
        MVLP by firing up Art Master and selecting sketch mode. Then put the MVLP 
        on the '+' on the screen, and slowly pull out and up at the same time. 
        The '+' should track along the MVLP movment. If you can pull the MVLP 
        out way past 1&quot; before the '+' stops, the brightness could be turned 
        down a little. If you can't even pull the MVLP out to 1&quot; then you 
        need to turn the brightness up a bit. The environment lighting will affect 
        the sensitivity also.</td>
