<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial" size="2">(I've never noticed how crappy
    the 'macro' option on my digital camera&nbsp;<br>
    was until I tried to get a decent picture of this thing.)</font></i></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial" size="3">The adapter was much smaller
    than I excepted, neatly packed inside a shrinked transparent&nbsp;<br>
    plastic tube to allow people to see what's inside. I don't know how Kevin
    managed to get the&nbsp;<br>
    DB-9 modified so cleanly to fit to the port on the Vectrex.</font></b></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>And from the miniplug side.
    That's where you&nbsp;<br>
    connect the Sega Master System 3D glasses.<br>
    I guess any other shutter-based 3D glasses with a miniplug&nbsp;<br>
    connector would work too... (have to confirm this)<br>
    As you can see, there's a bunch of technology inside there.<br>
    It is not just a simple converter, it actually emulates<br>
    the original Vectrex 3D goggles with all their quirks.</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>This is how it looks when
    plugged into a Vectrex.<br>
    I suggested Kevin using black shrink tube in the future to better match the
    console.<br>
    I'm happy with mine, though :)</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>And how was it? Well, I haven't
    had the honor to try the real goggles ever,<br>
    but I was quite impressed with this thing (and quite nauseated afterwards).<br>
    In Narrow Escape, I couldn't really see how they used the 3D effect to make<br>
    the game look any different, with Crazy Coaster there was some depth, but<br>
    oh boy oh boy did MineStorm 3D look cool! Those far away mines were<br>
    really far away - inside my Vectrex! :)</b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>Yeah well, it's missing the
    color option of the original goggles, but some might&nbsp;<br>
    argue the SMS glasses are cooler looking... and they sure are a lot cheaper!<br>
