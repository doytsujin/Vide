</div>
<br>
           This is the procedure I used to create the overlays for VeCaves.&nbsp; 
    It  took at lot of trial and error to get a good result, and I encourage 
   any other programmers to mess around and see if you can create something 
  better.<br>
<br>
<div align="Left">As you will see below, this method does not lend itself 
well to producing reproductions of the original overlays.&nbsp; This is intended
 to create multiple copies of the same overlay.&nbsp; You can use this for 
creating slightly modified versions of the original overlays, but it takes 
a bit of setup for each overlay you do.&nbsp; Click any picture for a larger

<big><big>Materials:</big></big><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Inkjet photo printer</b>.&nbsp; Using an inkjet is imperative. a
     color laser printer will create a dither which ruins the color filter
 effect    of the overylay.&nbsp; The key part of using an inkjet is that
the ink has   a chance to mix slightly after being sprayed onto the transperancy.&nbsp;
     This creates the uniform color needed to create the color filter.&nbsp;
   I  suspect that a dye sublimation printer might work well, but I don't
have    access to one to try.&nbsp; I used an HP deskjet 722C, which worked
quite    well</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>Color ink for above printer</b>!&nbsp; This is a significant portion
     of the cost of making an overlay.&nbsp; Using the HP deskjet, I found
 that    I could only print about 35 overlays before the color cartridge
ran  out.&nbsp;    The color cartridge for this printer is $35.&nbsp; If
you are  just doing   a couple overlays, this is no big deal, but if you
are producing  a bunch  for sale, keep in mind to that you will probably
run out.&nbsp; I ran out  to the store several times, so you may want to
buy the double packs.&nbsp;  I printed probably 90 overlays and color box
covers and never ran out of black ink.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/transperancy.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/transperancy_small.jpg" alt="Transperancy Film" height="176" width="155"></a><br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li><b>Transperancy film</b>.&nbsp; You must aquire transperancy film that
     is created for an inkjet, preferably for your specific brand.&nbsp;
Transperancy      film which is designed for a copier or laser printer will
not allow the    ink  to dry.&nbsp; I used both the Apollo and 3M brand transperancy
film&nbsp;     The Apollo film produced a little glossier image, but looked
like it had    a little dust on it.&nbsp; The 3M film produced an extremly
even image,   but   was much more matte.&nbsp; In either case, after you
laminate it, they  both   looked the same.&nbsp; Boxes of 50 sheets are much
cheaper than smaller   packages.&nbsp; Expect to pay about $0.75 per sheet
in packs of 20, and can  be purchased at office supply stores.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b>White spray paint</b>.&nbsp; This is needed for the white coloring
   on the back side of the overlay.&nbsp; If you just print an overlay, then
   put it on the vectrex, you will see that the entire overlay is extremely
  dark and unreadable.&nbsp; You will only see the coloring of the beam on
 the display.&nbsp; To allow the user to read your game logo and text on
the  overlay, the back of these areas must be colored white.&nbsp; This allows
 room light to go through the transperancy, and reflect off of the white
paint  on the backside, which is what you see.&nbsp; I had more luck with
a more  watery paint than a thicker one.&nbsp; I used a cheap quick drying
enamel   paint I picked up at the hardware store.&nbsp; Expect to pay $3,
and that   one can lasted me about 40 overlays.</li>
</ul>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/laminating.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/laminating_small.jpg" alt="Laminating sheets" height="197" width="168"></a><br>
</div>
<ul>
          &nbsp;                            
  <li><b>Lamination sheets</b>.&nbsp; Laminating the overlay is imperative
   for several reasons.&nbsp; The most important is that a printed transperancy
   has no thickness, and will not stand up on the vectrex very well.&nbsp;
 Another  is for protection of the ink and white paint.&nbsp; That said,
laminating    the overlay can be a very difficult task.&nbsp; There are two
primary problems    to using the traditional laminating methods.&nbsp; First
is that the heating&nbsp;    process to fuse the laminating sheets will cause
the transperancy to wrinkle&nbsp;    and warp.&nbsp; Second is that if you
manage to get the result flat(probably&nbsp;    by using a lower temperature),
then when you cut out the overlay, you end    up cutting off the edge, and
the lamination will come off.&nbsp; I found   that the best method is to
use "self adhesive" laminating sheets.&nbsp; Basically&nbsp;  these are full
sheet clear stickers.&nbsp; These are not cheap, and are a  real pain to
deal with, but with practice, the result works great.&nbsp; I used this JM
brand, which I found at an OfficeMax(50 sheets for $25), but  OfficeMax seems
to have stopped carrying them.&nbsp; Thier other brands are  more expensive,
and only sold in either 2 packs or 10 packs.&nbsp; I also  tested out the
Avery brand which was much more expensive, and I don't   think  had as nice
of a gloss to it.&nbsp; Expect to pay about $1 each sheet.&nbsp;    You need
2 sheets per overlay.&nbsp; These can be found at larger office   supply
stores, and can be difficult to find.</li>
</ul>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/papercutter.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/papercutter_small.jpg" alt="Paper cutter" height="189" width="163"></a><br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li><b>Paper cutter</b>.&nbsp; This is not required but makes cutting straight 
    lines much easier.&nbsp; You are going to be cutting through the entire 
  laminated  overlay, so a good quality paper cutter will save your hands 
from  cutting  them all with a pair of scissors.&nbsp; This one has a solid 
wood  base and  cast metal arm&nbsp; If you don't have one, check if you can
use  one at work,  or at a copy shop.</li>
  <li><b>Scissors</b>.&nbsp; You are going to need scissors for cutting the 
    corners and the finger notch.&nbsp; If you are going to be doing a lot, 
  I  would recommend finding a confortable pair.&nbsp; I can tell you that 
 after  cutting just the corners of 30 overlays, your hand gets pretty sore 
 using  a cheap pair.</li>
  <li><b>Straight edge</b>.&nbsp; You are going to need a firm straight edge
   to apply the lamination.&nbsp; A ruler works quite well.&nbsp; It needs
 to  be as wide as the entire width of a page, and firm enough so that you
 can  use considerable pressure on it and have it remain fairly straight.&nbsp;
   I used a hard plastic craft ruler which worked quite well.&nbsp; I would
  not recommend a metal ruler.&nbsp; A wooden one might work, but the edge
 needs to be very straight but at the same time not sharp.&nbsp; I think
a  plastic ruler is probably the best option by far.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/sleave.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/sleave_small.jpg" alt="Sleave" height="192" width="143"></a>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/sleavelabels.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/sleavelabels_small.jpg" alt="Sleave labels" height="192" width="264"></a><br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li><b>Sleaves</b>.&nbsp; This is an optional way of protecting the overlay. 
   &nbsp; I found that the protective bags used by comic book collectors work
   great for protecting overlays you give out with your game as well as protecting
   your entire overlay collection.&nbsp; I use them for all my overlays as
 they  protect the overlays from scratches and at the same time allow you
to see  them.&nbsp; If you choose to do this, note that there are several
sizes of  comic book bags, so make sure you get the right size.&nbsp; The
correct size  is the "current" or "new" size, which are for 6-7/8" by 10-1/2"
sized comics.&nbsp;  You need both the bag, and the backer board which are
white cardboard sheets  sized for the bags.&nbsp; The backer board provides
firmness and the white  background allows you to see the the overlay clearly.&nbsp;
  The backer boards  are too tall, and need to be cut down to 8-1/2" high.&nbsp;
  They are typically  sold in packs of 100 and can be found in most comic
book  shops..&nbsp; Expect  the bags to be $4 per 100, and the backer boards
to  be $8 per 100. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<big><big>Step 1:</big></big><br>
<b>Create the overlay design</b>.&nbsp; I used Corel Draw, which is a professional 
   drawing program.&nbsp; The primary advantage of using a drawing program 
 like  this is that all the parts of the image you draw are stored independantly 
   as objects.&nbsp; This is unlike a simple picture editing program which 
 adds  the new drawings over the original.&nbsp; This method allows you more 
 flexability  in creating the design as parts can be moved around, and placed 
 on top of  each other in any order.&nbsp; Another key advantage is that all
 of the drawn  objects are based on lines and curves from point to point.&nbsp; 
 This means  that the result doesn't have a 'resolution' per-se.&nbsp; This 
 is good because  when you print it, the 'image' will automatically take on
 the resolution of the printer.&nbsp; If you do decide to use a picture based
 drawing program,  be sure to make your resolution high enough so that you
 don't get an interferance  pattern when you print it.<br>
<br>
       No matter how you do it, create your image keeping in mind a couple
 things:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>Color does not always match</b>.&nbsp; The display on a vectrex appears
to have a white beam, but it is actually a blue-ish white.&nbsp; This created
quite a nusiance when doing the overlay for VeCaves.&nbsp; I wanted to make
the main portion of the overlay look brown.&nbsp; Problem was that when I
used brown on the overlay, it appeared grey and not at all brown on the screen.&nbsp;
I discovered that if I use orange, it creates a perfect brown when you look
at the screen through it.&nbsp; I would recommend printing a bunch of colors
you think you are going to use, and holding it up to the Vectrex screen to
see how it actually looks.</li>
  <li><b>All text areas should be simply shaped</b>.&nbsp; Any area of the 
   overlay that you want the game player to see as an image instead of a color
   filter for the display must have white painted on the back side of the
overlay.&nbsp;   To do this, a stencil must be created.&nbsp; I recommend 
that you keep in   mind the shape of the stencil when designing the overlay.&nbsp; 
Small areas   won't work very well with the stencil.&nbsp; This precludes 
anything like   the grid pattern in the original Minestorm overlay.&nbsp; 
This is one of  the reasons that using this method for creating reproductions 
of the original   overlays is difficult.&nbsp; I recommend only expecting 
an outside boarder   and blocky logo area at the bottom.</li>
  <li><b>Colored areas should be general</b>.&nbsp; I created blue colored 
  areas for the scores, a red area for the high score, and a green area for 
  the ribbon in VeCaves.&nbsp; Keep in mind that many Vectrexes are adjusted 
  slightly differently, so the spot that you think the high score will be 
may  be a bit different from where the score is on a different Vectrex.&nbsp; 
 Before you layout these areas, I highly recommend that you use the test rom
 that is available on the web and Sean Kelly's multicart to tune up your Vectrex
  first.&nbsp; The test rom and the accompanying documentation(find it at
    <a href="http://www.playvectrex.com/">  Brett's Vectrex preserve</a> )
gives you fixed displays that you can line  up with each other and the edges
of the screen.&nbsp; If you do this first,  you will know that any Vectrex
which is properly adjusted will show the score  in the same spot as the overlay.&nbsp;
 After this, make your colored area  a bit bigger so that it will work with
 Vectrexes that are not aligned quite  as well.&nbsp; If you are unable to
 adjust your Vectrex, try it out on someone  elses, or send a prototype to
 someone who has adjusted thiers, and have them  tape a clear transperancy
 to thier screen, and then draw on the transperancy  where all the graphics
 are located at.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<big><big>Step 2:</big></big><br>
<b> Print the overlay</b>.&nbsp; Use a good quality photo inkjet printer.&nbsp;
   Again the goal is to get a lot of ink onto the transperancy.&nbsp; Typically
   this is done by setting your printer for printing onto a transperancy
with    a quality of "best" or "photo".<br>
<br>
      Here is the result set on a piece of white paper to make it visible.<br>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/print.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/print_small.jpg" alt="Printed Transperancy" height="176" width="155"></a><br>
</div>
<br>
      Inkjet transperancies are made to only print on one side.&nbsp; This
 side   is made with a special textured surface to accept the ink and allow
 it to   dry.&nbsp; When you load the transperancy into the printer make
sure  you  load it properly to print on the correct side.&nbsp; Check the
directions   included with the transperancies.&nbsp; Again, make sure you
get transperancies   made for your brand of printer.<br>
<br>
      Once you print on the transperancy, I suggest being extremely careful 
 not  to touch the image part of the print until you have laminated it.&nbsp;
  I  found that because of the textured surface, it is just about impossible
  to  get finger prints off of the printed side of the sheet.&nbsp; The backside
   can be cleaned off, but it is much easier to just keep it clear of fingerprints
   and dust.<br>
<br>
<big><big>Step 3:</big></big><br>
<b> Create the stencil</b>.&nbsp; The next step is going to be to paint the
  white outline on the back side of the transperancy.&nbsp; To do this, you
  need to create a stencil.&nbsp; I found that a thin piece of masonite wood
  worked quite well.&nbsp; Masonite is a very dense composite fiber board.&nbsp;
   I also tested out a simple paper stencil and one made of cardboard.&nbsp;
   The paper one did not work at all because it did not stay flat when the
 paint  was sprayed.&nbsp; The air movement caused the paper to lift up.&nbsp;
 The  one made of cardboard worked, but the paint wicked up into the cardboard.&nbsp;
   This ment that after one or two overlays, the paint started splotching
onto   the center part of the overlay.&nbsp; I was able to scratch it off
after  it dried, but I don't think this would work well for more than a few
overlays.   &nbsp;&nbsp; The key with the masonite is that the paint did
not wick into   it at all.&nbsp; I suspect that glass, plexi-glass or metal
would work as   well if those are more handy materials for you.<br>
<br>
      Here you can see my stencil(well coated with white paint) sitting on
 top   of an upside down printed transperancy.&nbsp; The stencil is lined
up and   ready for paint.&nbsp; Notice that I glued a block of wood on the
back of   the stencil so that after painting I can quickly lift the stencil
up.&nbsp;   Also notice that although I have a bed of old newspaper to prevent
the paint   from coloring the basement floor, I placed a sheet of plain white
 paper between  the transperancy and the paper.&nbsp; Otherwise, the newspaper
 ink would rub off onto the transperancy and ruin it.&nbsp; When you create
 your stencil,  remember that it goes on the back side of transperancy.&nbsp;
 This means that it is a mirror of the normal image.<br>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/stencil.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/stencil_small.jpg" alt="Stencil" height="176" width="161"></a><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<big><big>Step 4:</big></big><br>
<b> Paint the back of the overlay</b>.&nbsp; I found that I had the most
 luck by doing a couple things when painting.&nbsp; First, apply pressure
to the stencil to make sure it is fully pressed against the overlay.&nbsp;
I simply used a pole I pushed down on during the process.&nbsp; Second, paint
   quickly, and lift up the stencil as soon as you are done.&nbsp; If I left
   it on too long, the paint will wick in between the stencil and the transperancy.<br>
<br>
      Here is the result after painting, and then after removing the stencil.<br>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/paintedoverlay.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/paintedoverlay_small.jpg" alt="Painted Overlay" height="176" width="154"></a>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/paintedoverlay2.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/paintedoverlay2_small.jpg" alt="Painted Overlay" height="176" width="157"></a><br>
</div>
      Ideally, you would paint one, and allow all the paint on the stencil
 to  dry before placing it on another transperancy and painting another.&nbsp; 
  However, this is impossible if you have to make a lot of overlays.&nbsp; 
 If you opt not to let the paint on the stencil dry, you need to be careful 
 in a couple areas.&nbsp; First, wipe any paint off the bottom of the stencil 
  that leaked in.&nbsp; Second, after 5 or 6, you will build up quite a layer 
  of liquid paint on the stencil.&nbsp; I found that I had to wipe off the 
 thickest parts of the paint, especially near the edges.&nbsp; If I didn't, 
 this paint would leak down onto the transperancy.&nbsp; Third, be very careful 
 when you place the wet stencil on the next transperancy so that you don't 
 smear paint onto the inner part of the overlay.<br>
<br>
      I found that while I was painting each transperancy every couple minutes,
   I had to wait until the paint on the stencil dried after painting about
 30.&nbsp;  At that point the smears and leaking just gets too bad.&nbsp;
This point is also good to allow the paint to dry so that you can use a knife
to cut off the thick layers of paint from the stencil.&nbsp; The paint gets
so thick,  that the corners and edges of the stencil get "blurry".<br>
<div align="Center"><br>
</div>
       &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<big><big>Step 5:</big></big><br>
<b> Clean the overlay</b>.&nbsp; Once the paint on the back is completely
   dry, store it so that it will not get any dust on it.&nbsp; Just before
 you  laminate it you want to make extra sure that there is no dust or finger
 prints  on it.&nbsp; I found that it is very difficult to clean dust off
the printed  side of the transperancy.&nbsp; The best way that I could find
was an extremely  light brushing with the side of my hand.&nbsp; The back
side is much easier  and could be done with a lint free clean cloth.&nbsp;
If you have finger prints on the back side, a little pressure is required.&nbsp;
 I found that this pressure actually caused a marking in the ink on the front,
 so I would recommend laminating the front side before applying the pressure.<br>
<br>
      This seems like an obvious step, but I cannot overstate it's importance.&nbsp;
   It is very easy to overlook the smallest bit of dust.&nbsp; Just a tiny
 bit  will cause a large dimple in the laminating process which will look
horrible.<br>
<br>
<big><big>Step 6:</big></big><br>
<b> Laminate the overlay</b>.&nbsp; This is one of the hardest parts to get
  good at.&nbsp; A lot can go wrong at this stage.&nbsp; Even after doing
50  overlays, I still lost 5 to 10% of my overlays at this point.<br>
<br>
      The self adhesive laminating sheets are full sheet clear stickers on
 a  paper  backing.&nbsp; The best way to apply the lamination is to peal
back  an edge  of the sheet, and slowly apply it at the same time as it comes
of  the backing.&nbsp;  If you peal the entire lamination off the backing
and  attempt to apply it,  you will end up with bubbles, wrinkles or stretching.<br>
<br>
      First, peal back an edge of the sheet:<br>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/laminatingsheet.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/laminatingsheet_small.jpg" alt="Peal back edge of sheet" height="226" width="359"></a><br>
</div>
<br>
      The sheets I choose are quite a bit larger than the final overlay,
so  a  good area of the sheet around the edges is discarded in the next step.&nbsp; 
  This means that finger prints on the edge of the laminating sheets is ok, 
  but I would still recommend keeping the area as untouched as possible.<br>
<br>
      Next line up the laminating sheet so that you can "roll" it onto the
 overlay   with the straight edge.&nbsp; The sticky side should be down with
 the pealed   off part of the paper backing resting on the overlay.&nbsp;
At this point   it is probably useful to mention that you should be working
on an extremly   smooth flat hard table.&nbsp; Ideally a glass table top.&nbsp;
 I would not   recommend a natural wood table surface as its grain is either
 not smooth  enough, or if it is laquered smooth, the laquer might get marred
 from the  pressure applied with the ruler.&nbsp; It is useful to allow the
 laminating  sheets to stick the overlay to the table as it helps hold it
in place, so  you obviously want a table you can peal it off of without damage
 to the table.&nbsp;  <br>
<br>
      When you line up the sheet, do not attempt to press it down onto the
 table   or the overlay with your hands.&nbsp; I found it worked best to
use  your  hand to hold up the backing, then simply allow the sheet to rest
evenly  on  the table at the edgeof the sheet.&nbsp; This helps ensure that
when you apply the sheet it will not bubble, wrinkle or stretch.&nbsp; If
you get it slightly kinked, you may manage to keep the wrinkles out, but
in doing  that you have stretched the lamination sheet.&nbsp; When you pick
up the overlay you will discover that it is now curled, and cannot be flattened.&nbsp;
It must be discarded and you will have to try again.&nbsp; Note that because
 the laminating sheet is so much larger than the resulting overlay, it is
actually not very important to line up the laminating sheet with the overlay.&nbsp;
 The important part is to get the laminating sheet applied evenly. (even
if  it is slightly crooked compared to the overlay)<br>
<br>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/laminatingsheet2.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/laminatingsheet2_small.jpg" alt="Lineing up the laminating sheet" height="245" width="481"></a><br>
</div>
      Next use the straight edge to press the laminating sheet down onto
the   table.&nbsp;  I found it worked best to line it up about 1/2 inch into
the   laminating sheet  from the edge.&nbsp; This means that the first 1/2
inch   may not be flat, but it is ok, as this section will be cut off and
discarded.&nbsp;   The sheets  I used are about 1 inch longer than the transperancy,
so this   allows you to actually press the laminating sheet onto the table
instead  of the transperancy.<br>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/laminatingsheet3.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/laminatingsheet3_small.jpg" alt="Lining up the ruler" height="230" width="432"></a><br>
</div>
      Next apply the laminating sheet.&nbsp; This must be done with a smooth
  uniform  stroke.&nbsp; Use both hands to apply downward pressure on the
ruler,  and  slowly slide the ruler forward.&nbsp; If you stuck the leading
edge of the  laminating sheet to the table, then the overlay will stay put
and will not  slide away.&nbsp; Make sure that you slike the ruler forward
with a uniform  forward pressure.&nbsp; If at any point you stop, you will
create  a small  wrinkle, which you will not be able to smooth out.&nbsp;
If you have setup  the laminating sheet right, the paper backing will peal
off automatically   as the laminating sheet gets applied to the overlay.&nbsp;
Be careful to  hold the ruler straight and apply even downward pressure across
the entire  length of it.&nbsp; I found that about 10 pounds of downard pressure
was required.&nbsp; Further, as little forward pressure should be applied
as possible.&nbsp; If you apply to much, the laminating sheet will be stretched
 resulting in a curled overlay.&nbsp; The picture below shows me using only
 one hand because I was taking this picture.&nbsp; I highly recommend using
 both hands on the ruller.<br>
<div align="Center"><a href="http://maxwell.fief.org/images/laminatingsheet4.jpg"><img src="How%20to%20create%20a%20Vectrex%20overlay-Dateien/laminatingsheet4_small.jpg" alt="Applying the laminating sheet" height="229" width="400"></a><br>
</div>
      I mentioned above that the paper backing will peal off automatically.&nbsp;
   This requires that there be nothing in the way on the table.&nbsp; Another
   thing to note is that if you have done one side, and are doing the other
  side, the paper backing may get stuck on the last edge of the stickly lamination
   from the first side.&nbsp; This happens near the end.&nbsp; If you find
 this  a problem, I recommend having someone help you and hold the other
end  of the paper backing up slightly.&nbsp; Remember, do not peal the entire
backing  off.&nbsp; Allow it to come off as the lamination is applied.<br>
<br>
      Next, while the overlay is still stuck to the table, you need to get
 the   lamination fully applied to the transperancy.&nbsp; Even with the
downward    pressure you applied to put on the lamination, I found that the
sticky adhesive   on the back of the lamination was not fully adheared to
the transperancy.&nbsp;    This shows up as blurry areas.&nbsp; To fully
apply the lamination, run  the  ruler over the overlay applying a lot of
pressure. This is where a strong    ruler is required.&nbsp; I found that
I needed to apply probably 40 or 50   pounds of pressure to get all of the
adhesive applied fully.&nbsp; By doing   this, you should see the blurry
areas clear up.&nbsp; The result should be  crystal clear.&nbsp; I found
that it was best to draw the ruler back over  the overlay applying pressure
instead of pushing it forward.&nbsp; This prevents  it from digging in.&nbsp;
I am talking about moving it in the opposite direction  used when first applying
the lamination shown above.&nbsp; If you use a straight  edge with a sharp
edge, applying this much pressure will cause it to dig into the overlay causing
a dent, and possibly ripping the laminating sticker.&nbsp;  This is why a
metal ruler will not work well.&nbsp;   If you did get some dust  stuck in
between, be very careful how you run the  ruler over this area so  that you
don't rip the laminating sheet.&nbsp; If  you are careful, you can  finish
out the overlay, and perhaps the dust is  small enough to ignore.<br>
<br>
      If you ended up with bubbles or wrinkles in the lamination process, 
it  means  that you did not line up the sheet evenly.&nbsp; See the part above
 about  allowing the laminating sheet to come to rest on the table instead
 of pressing  it down with your fingers.<br>
<br>
      If the result is curled in the long direction, it means that you applied
   to much foward pressure causing the lamination to be stretched.&nbsp;
Once    you finish applying the laminating sheet, it relaxes and contracts
causing    the curl.&nbsp; You can try applying the lamination on the other
side to   "cancel" out the curl, but I would just give up and try again on
a new one.<br>
<br>
      If the result is curled in the short direction, you probably did not
 line   up the sheet quite evenly.&nbsp; It is probably just slightly offset,
 and   the downward pressure you applied prevented wrinkles or bubbles, but
 caused   the sheet to be stretched horizontally causing the curl.&nbsp;
Unfortunitely    this means another one down the drain.<br>
<br>
      Now, peal the overlay off your table, flip over, and repeat this process
   on the other side.<br>
<br>
      Over all, I hope you can see that this step is by far the hardest to
 master   and is the most likely way to ruin an overlay.&nbsp; If you are
making a  bunch of overlays, I would recommend making 10% more than you think
you need  to cover for mess ups.<br>
<br>
<big><big>Step 7:</big></big><br>
<b> Cut out the overlay</b>.&nbsp; Before cutting, I found that stacking
 up all my laminated overlays, and putting a pile of books on top for a day
   or so helped take out any slight curls in the overlays.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
      Actually cutting out the overlay is as you would expect.&nbsp; The
paper    cutter comes in handy for cutting the long straight edges, but you
will  need  to cut the corners and the finger hole with a pair of scissors.&nbsp;
 The  cutting takes a bit more pressure than normal paper because you are
cutting  through the plastic transperancy, the layer of paint and both laminating
  sheets, so you might want to give your hands a break after cutting out
a  dozen or two.&nbsp; I would recommend a sturdy sharp paper cutter and
scissors  because you need to get through all three layers without stretching
them.&nbsp;  If you don't cut through all three in the same line, the laminating
sheet  could stick off the edge, and be prone to pealing later in life.<br>
<br>
      When you cut them out, make sure you are cutting the proper size.&nbsp; 
  If you cut the overlay to small, it will fall off of the vectrex.&nbsp; 
Slightly  to large, and you will have a very hard time cutting just a sliver 
off of  it.<br>
<br>
<big><big>Step 8:</big></big><br>
<b> Put the overlay in a protective bag</b>.&nbsp; I liked to give the result
   a good polishing with a clean lint free piece of cloth to remove finger
 prints  before putting it in the protective bag.&nbsp; Simply fold over
the  plastic  bag, and tape shut with a small piece of sticky tape.<br>

<br>
<big><big>Comments:</big></big><br>
     Overall, expect an overlay will take about 20 to 30 minutes to hand
make(assuming   that you have assembly lined the process).&nbsp; I can tell
you that this   gets quite tiring after a while, but the result is worth
it!<br>
<br>
     Now that I've told you how I made mine, and how you can make your own, 
 I  ask that any other homebrewers use this method(or create an even better 
 one)  and release overlays with your game.&nbsp; Overlays add so much to 
the fun  of the Vectrex!<br>

<big><big>     Ideas:</big></big><br>
      I had a couple ideas that someone could experiment with that may make 
 the  result look better     
<ul>
  <li>Using standard thermal laminating sheets would result in an even thicker 
  overlay.&nbsp; The problems I mentioned above are that the transperancy 
will  melt in the process, or that when you trim the overlay, the lamination 
will  come off.&nbsp; The idea is to use this type of laminating process, 
but to  prevent the transperancy from melting, and to make sure the lamination 
 is  solid.&nbsp; Take a couple plates of smooth clean metal.&nbsp; Put the 
 transperancy  in the laminating pouch, and place it between the metal sheets.&nbsp; 
 Now  apply pressure to hold the metal sheets togather, either stack more 
metal  on top to weigh it down, or use C-clamps.&nbsp; Next stick it in your 
oven  and turn up the heat.&nbsp; The hope is that this will allow the lamination 
  pouch to melt completely onto the transperancy, and yet not mess up the 
transperancy.&nbsp; I have no idea if this will ever work, and if it does, 
it will probably take  a bunch of playing around to get the temperature and 
heating time just right.</li>
  <li>Try using a dye sublimation printer instead of an inkjet.&nbsp; This 
  may yeild a better print.</li>
  <li>Try to find a print shop which can actually print the white on the back
side instead of using the stencil and paint technique.&nbsp; I have never
heard of a printing process which actually lays down white ink, but GCE must
have had a way to do it with the original overlays.<br>
  </li>
