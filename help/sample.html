<h1>Sample</h1>

<p>Some information:
<ol><li>
<p>Internally all samples are kept in the format:<br />

<ul><li>
<p>44100 khz<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>2 channel<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>16 bit<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>signed<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>little endian<br />
</p>
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>this is what you see in the sample display window (left channel)<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Recording is done with the settings you enter to the right <br />
(and is than converted to above format)</p>
</li><li>
<p>(the original) samples can be saved, save format is "wav", saving is done in the above format, since in this format all information is kept (internally) anyway.</p>
</li><li>
<p>(the vectrex) samples can be saved, save format is "wav", saving is done in the  format chosen (only sample rate can be chosen, the rest is allways set).</p>
</li><li>
<p>you can save the vectrex samples as "raw" data, the raw data uses 8 bit signed data (this is what vectrex wants)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Normalization uses no range compression algorithm, this is just a maximization so that the largest absolut sample reaches its format maximum (and all other samples are scaled accordingly)</p>
</li></ol>
