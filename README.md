VIDE

Vide is a collection of different sources - and some new creations - in a single application.
It is a Vectrex Integrated Developement Environment.

I do not intend to make VIDE an "emulator of choice".

It will not be as pretty as ParaJVE, it will not be as fast as VecX and it won't be as "elegant" as the MAME/MESS emulation.

For further information take a look at malbans homepage for Vide:
